Tunes are those that are typically suitable for contra dancing or other traditional fiddle tunes.<\/p>\n\n<p>This group is intended to provide a musical home for folks interested in playing tunes with other musicians, learning to play by ear and overall increasing their own musical skill. It&rsquo;s fun and welcoming to all ages and levels of playing. While we won&rsquo;t play from sheet music, you can certainly use this as a reference on your own!<br />\n<br />\nWhat do you mean by slow jam? All acoustic instruments (e.g., fiddle, mandolin, guitar, cello, etc.) are welcome and the typical format is that we sit in a circle (or circle-ish, depending on the space) and take turns suggesting/leading a song. The songs will typically follow the AABB format (two &ldquo;A&rdquo; parts followed by two &ldquo;B&rdquo; parts) and we will simply play it over many repeats and if you know it, great, but if you don&rsquo;t, you try to figure it out as we go along, maybe picking up a few notes here and there. We&rsquo;ll play tunes at a slow to moderate speed so that they are accessible to a variety of levels.<br />\n<br />\nIt&rsquo;s fun and can be challenging, but is a great way to improve your playing. You don&rsquo;t have to be a great player, play in tune, or know the songs to give it a shot. If you want to suggest a song, you should either know the song well enough to play it on repeat or we can see if anyone else does!<br />\n <\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 9:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: Old Stone House (in J.J.

And we understand the imperative of that tradition: to make it real for us we must live it and bring our own creativity into it, thus half of our repertoire is original compositions, all underpinned by that deep rhythmically complex African groove. Our music is exuberantly infectious, expressing an unmistakable spiritual dimension and great artistic complexity, and we are delighted at the opportunity to share it on this, our sixth American tour!<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 6:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 8:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (505) 204-8960<\/p><p>Location: Garibaldi Plaza (in Washington Square Park)<\/p>","parkids":"M098","parknames":"Washington Square Park","start":"2019-09-06 18:00:00","end":"2019-09-06 20:00:00","contact_phone":"(505) 204-8960","location":"Garibaldi Plaza (in Washington Square Park)","categories":"Concerts | Art | Best for Kids | Free Summer Concerts","coordinates":"40.73049926757812500, -73.99700164794922000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5d5c433e2226e.jpg","pubDate":"Mon, 02 Sep 2019 23:59:49 EDT","pretty_time":"Sep 06 06:00 PM"},{"title":"Queensboro Dance Festival","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/09/06/queensboro-dance-festival1","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/09/06/queensboro-dance-festival1","description":"<p>Date: September 6, 2019<\/p><p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.queensborodancefestival.com/\">Queensboro Dance Festival<\/a> returns to the Hunter&rsquo;s Point Park waterfront with free performances by a diverse lineup of cultural and contemporary Queens dance companies.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 6:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 8:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: LIC Landing Events Space (in Hunter's Point South Park)<\/p>","parkids":"Q471","parknames":"Hunter's Point South Park","start":"2019-09-06 18:00:00","end":"2019-09-06 20:00:00","location":"LIC Landing Events Space (in Hunter's Point South Park)","categories":"Concerts | Dance | Waterfront","coordinates":"40.74312210083000000, -73.96025848388700000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5cfeab5fde07c.jpg","pubDate":"Mon, 02 Sep 2019 23:59:49 EDT","pretty_time":"Sep 06 06:00 PM"},{"title":"Evening Farm Experience","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/09/06/evening-farm-experience","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/09/06/evening-farm-experience","description":"<p>Date: September 6, 2019<\/p><p><p>Join us for a tour of the beautiful Urban Farm.

Prospect Park Alliance and Turnstile Tours host a series of themed walking tours that examine the many layers of natural and human history to be found in Brooklyn&#39;s Backyard. Tours begin at the Brooklyn Public Library at Grand Army Plaza.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Hidden Treasures Tour (1st Sundays):<\/strong> Explore some of the little-known corners of Prospect Park in this tour that uncovers some of the park&rsquo;s hidden treasures. Once prime attractions, these areas are currently the focus of Prospect Park Alliance restoration efforts to revitalize the park. The tour includes the Rose Garden and Vale of Cashmere in the park&rsquo;s northeast corner, and well as a guided walk through Brooklyn&rsquo;s last remaining forest, the 150-acre Ravine.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Waterways & Wellhouse Tour (2nd Sundays): <\/strong>Prospect Park is an engineering marvel, designed around an ingenious drainage system and a chain of manmade streams and ponds that terminate in Brooklyn&rsquo;s largest lake. This tour will follow the park&rsquo;s scenic watercourse and delve into how Prospect Park Alliance maintains and supports this complex system. The tour will end with a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most unique features of the park: the 1869 Wellhouse, the park&rsquo;s last remaining building by park designer Calvert Vaux, which once housed the machinery that fueled the  watercourse and was recently restored by the Alliance and converted into the first composting restrooms in a NYC park.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Art & Architecture Tour (3rd Sundays): <\/strong>For over 150 years, Prospect Park has been a showcase for beautiful public buildings and artwork, with representations from eras including Beaux-Arts, City Beautiful, the New Deal Modernism, and contemporary LEED-certified projects. This tour will examine some of the fine architectural details and ongoing restoration work, from the era of Vaux and Olmsted to the present day.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Brooklyn&rsquo;s Backyard Tour &ndash; includes Zoo and Carousel admission (4th Sundays): <\/strong>Prospect Park is an oasis for people &ndash; and animals! Discover the native habitats and inhabitants of the park, and explore the past and present of recreation, animals, and ongoing conservation efforts of the Prospect Park Alliance. This tour includes an interactive scavenger for children and adults, and ends at the park&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Corner, with a special visit to Prospect Park Zoo and tickets to ride the historic Carousel.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.prospectpark.org/visit-the-park/things-to-do/tours/\">Learn more and get tickets today<\/a>!<\/strong><\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 10:30 am<\/p><p>End time: 12:30 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: Prospect Park<\/p>","parkids":"B073","parknames":"Prospect Park","start":"2019-09-08 10:30:00","end":"2019-09-08 12:30:00","location":"Prospect Park","categories":"Art | History | Tours","coordinates":"40.66170120239258000, -73.97080230712890000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5c9a84bce58c9.JPG","pubDate":"Mon, 02 Sep 2019 23:59:49 EDT","pretty_time":"Sep 08 10:30 AM"},{"title":"Grandparents Day Celebration","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/09/08/grandparents-day-celebration","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/09/08/grandparents-day-celebration","description":"<p>Date: September 8, 2019<\/p><p><p>Spend a special day with Grandma or Grandpa!

This tour will follow the park&rsquo;s scenic watercourse and delve into how Prospect Park Alliance maintains and supports this complex system. The tour will end with a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most unique features of the park: the 1869 Wellhouse, the park&rsquo;s last remaining building by park designer Calvert Vaux, which once housed the machinery that fueled the  watercourse and was recently restored by the Alliance and converted into the first composting restrooms in a NYC park.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Art & Architecture Tour (3rd Sundays): <\/strong>For over 150 years, Prospect Park has been a showcase for beautiful public buildings and artwork, with representations from eras including Beaux-Arts, City Beautiful, the New Deal Modernism, and contemporary LEED-certified projects.
