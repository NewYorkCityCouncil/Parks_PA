Each has explored narratives about contested space that draw on personal and cultural touch points, reflecting a synergy to their work and shared interests that will be reinforced by their projects this spring.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hoffman&rsquo;s mixed-media paintings and installations take inspiration from the Philippine weaving and the Jewish folk traditions of her ancestors, layered geographies emerging from materials collected from her everyday life. Based in Brooklyn, Hupfield is a citizen of the Anishinaabek Nation from Wasauksing First Nation in Ontario, Canada. Her sculptural body-objects, crafted from industrial felt, are often activated through performance. Also based in Brooklyn, Filipina-Canadian artist Jimenez&rsquo;s installations and performances draw from familial narratives, abandoned objects and colonial texts, as well as photos, maps, and textiles, to focus on concepts of origin and home, loss and absence. In the Sunroom Project Space, Rachel Sydlowski&rsquo;s installation consists of layers of historical wallpaper that serve as a background for complex, screen-print collages of flora and fauna, architectural details and decorative motifs from Wave Hill, Inwood Hill Park and other surrounding green spaces, transforming the Sunroom into an anachronistic collage of past and present.

Prospect Park Alliance and Turnstile Tours host a series of themed walking tours that examine the many layers of natural and human history to be found in Brooklyn&#39;s Backyard. Tours begin at the Brooklyn Public Library at Grand Army Plaza.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Hidden Treasures Tour (1st Sundays):<\/strong> Explore some of the little-known corners of Prospect Park in this tour that uncovers some of the park&rsquo;s hidden treasures.

This tour will follow the park&rsquo;s scenic watercourse and delve into how Prospect Park Alliance maintains and supports this complex system. The tour will end with a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most unique features of the park: the 1869 Wellhouse, the park&rsquo;s last remaining building by park designer Calvert Vaux, which once housed the machinery that fueled the  watercourse and was recently restored by the Alliance and converted into the first composting restrooms in a NYC park.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Art & Architecture Tour (3rd Sundays): <\/strong>For over 150 years, Prospect Park has been a showcase for beautiful public buildings and artwork, with representations from eras including Beaux-Arts, City Beautiful, the New Deal Modernism, and contemporary LEED-certified projects. This tour will examine some of the fine architectural details and ongoing restoration work, from the era of Vaux and Olmsted to the present day.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Brooklyn&rsquo;s Backyard Tour &ndash; includes Zoo and Carousel admission (4th Sundays): <\/strong>Prospect Park is an oasis for people &ndash; and animals! Discover the native habitats and inhabitants of the park, and explore the past and present of recreation, animals, and ongoing conservation efforts of the Prospect Park Alliance.

Each has explored narratives about contested space that draw on personal and cultural touch points, reflecting a synergy to their work and shared interests that will be reinforced by their projects this spring.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hoffman&rsquo;s mixed-media paintings and installations take inspiration from the Philippine weaving and the Jewish folk traditions of her ancestors, layered geographies emerging from materials collected from her everyday life. Based in Brooklyn, Hupfield is a citizen of the Anishinaabek Nation from Wasauksing First Nation in Ontario, Canada. Her sculptural body-objects, crafted from industrial felt, are often activated through performance. Also based in Brooklyn, Filipina-Canadian artist Jimenez&rsquo;s installations and performances draw from familial narratives, abandoned objects and colonial texts, as well as photos, maps and textiles, to focus on concepts of origin and home, loss and absence. In the Sunroom Project Space, Rachel Sydlowski&rsquo;s installation consists of layers of historical wallpaper that serve as a background for complex, screen-print collages of flora and fauna, architectural details and decorative motifs from Wave Hill, Inwood Hill Park and other surrounding green spaces, transforming the Sunroom into an anachronistic collage of past and present.

Tunes are those that are typically suitable for contra dancing or other traditional fiddle tunes.<\/p>\n\n<p>This group is intended to provide a musical home for folks interested in playing tunes with other musicians, learning to play by ear and overall increasing their own musical skill. It&rsquo;s fun and welcoming to all ages and levels of playing. While we won&rsquo;t play from sheet music, you can certainly use this as a reference on your own!<br />\n<br />\nWhat do you mean by slow jam? All acoustic instruments (e.g., fiddle, mandolin, guitar, cello, etc.) are welcome and the typical format is that we sit in a circle (or circle-ish, depending on the space) and take turns suggesting/leading a song. The songs will typically follow the AABB format (two &ldquo;A&rdquo; parts followed by two &ldquo;B&rdquo; parts) and we will simply play it over many repeats and if you know it, great, but if you don&rsquo;t, you try to figure it out as we go along, maybe picking up a few notes here and there. We&rsquo;ll play tunes at a slow to moderate speed so that they are accessible to a variety of levels.<br />\n<br />\nIt&rsquo;s fun and can be challenging, but is a great way to improve your playing. You don&rsquo;t have to be a great player, play in tune, or know the songs to give it a shot.

Trees New York&rsquo;s Citizen Pruner Tree Care Course trains volunteers in tree care, biology, identification, and pruning. The course consists of eight hours of classroom training, four hours of hands-on experience in the field, and a test on the information learned in the class. Pruning helps produce strong, healthy and attractive trees. Pruning strengthens a tree&rsquo;s resistance to damage and breakage and prevents the formation of large wounds that often lead to tree failure or decay. Removing dead and damaged limbs improves the overall health of the tree and reduces the likelihood of branches falling, which can cause injuries and property damage.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>To apply, please visit <a href=\"http://bit.ly/GreenThumbPruner\">bit.ly/GreenThumbPruner<\/a>. Deadline to apply: Monday, April 8. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>GreenThumb has reserved a limited number of seats for community gardeners to get certified. Gardeners must apply to take the course.

This tour will follow the park&rsquo;s scenic watercourse and delve into how Prospect Park Alliance maintains and supports this complex system. The tour will end with a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most unique features of the park: the 1869 Wellhouse, the park&rsquo;s last remaining building by park designer Calvert Vaux, which once housed the machinery that fueled the  watercourse and was recently restored by the Alliance and converted into the first composting restrooms in a NYC park.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Art & Architecture Tour (3rd Sundays): <\/strong>For over 150 years, Prospect Park has been a showcase for beautiful public buildings and artwork, with representations from eras including Beaux-Arts, City Beautiful, the New Deal Modernism, and contemporary LEED-certified projects.

Since 1998, Campbell has used remote control toys, spiky plastic balls, string, GPS tracks, and other non-conventional tools to create works that simultaneously pay homage and parody the great abstract painters of the past. He combines non-traditional and traditional painting methods to create hybrid images.<\/p>\n\n<p>Although the works are abstract in appearance they often suggest elements of nature, fireworks, portals into some unknown world, and influences of other cultures and traditions. They represent movement and are a metaphor for connections that exist in our everyday lives.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://snugharbor.secure.force.com/ticket/#sections_a0F1H00000FWTgnUAH\">Purchase tickets online.<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Paul Campbell&rsquo;s work has been exhibited extensively in the US and abroad. He has exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum, the Danforth Museum, the Rose Art Museum, Site Santa Fe, and Lesley Heller Gallery in New York. His first major solo show in New York in 1999 was called &ldquo;Remote Control&rdquo; at Roebling Hall Gallery where he showed paintings made with remote control cars. Campbell has received several grants including the Pollock Krasner Foundation Grant and has participated in several international art projects and residencies in Europe, South America, India, Singapore, and China. He has also participated in public art projects including a 65 foot mural on Flushing Avenue at Clinton Avenue in Brooklyn based on GPS tracks and most recently a bus stop was opened featuring his work. Campbell&rsquo;s studio is located in the Brooklyn Navy Yard in Brooklyn, NY.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>All exhibits and programs are located in the Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art (Buildings C & G).

In addition, this historic house museum also illuminates the life and achievements of other distinguished African-American scientists.<\/p>\n\n<p>A group of citizens, led by Tom Lloyd and Rev. Mitchell with assistance from the Queens Historical Society, quickly formed the Committee to Save the Latimer House and launched a major campaign in order to preserve the historic house from imminent destruction. Two prominent Preservation Committee members were also Latimer&rsquo;s grandchildren: Gerald Latimer Norman and Winifred Latimer Norman.<\/p>\n\n<p>Join Debbie Allen, the project manager in charge of the historic house move, as she recounts the incredible journey, thirty years ago, and the remarkable collaboration between a small group of devoted Flushing advocates, dozens of city agencies, and community members.<\/p>\n\n<p>After the presentation, Ms. Allen will lead the audience for a short, 10-minute walk to the Lewis Latimer House Museum, where self-guided and docent-led tours of the Landmarked site will be offered.
