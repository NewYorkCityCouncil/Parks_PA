Through the lens of a Black femme figure, this visual essay uses gesture, choreography, and text to address an increasing presence of anhedonia today, as it pertains to the denial of the pleasure of making mistakes: the joy of being bad and wrong.<\/p>\n\n<p>Autumn Knight creates performances and videos that examine and reframe oversimplified ideas about race, gender, history, and marginalized peoples. Much of her works centers around consumption, namely, the ways we take in and are taken in by one another. At once revolting and intriguing, Knight explores the tension between desire and disgust, and the ways in which those on the margins are often trapped between these polarities. Much of Knight&rsquo;s recent work is inspired by bell hooks&rsquo; essay &ldquo;Eating the Other: Desire and Resistance,&rdquo; and hooks&rsquo; analysis of the ways we understand, control, realize, and resist power.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 8:30 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 206-9922<\/p><p>Location: On the High Line at 14th Street (in The High Line)<\/p>","parkids":"M360","parknames":"The High Line","start":"2019-07-11 19:00:00","end":"2019-07-11 20:30:00","contact_phone":"(212) 206-9922","location":"On the High Line at 14th Street (in The High Line)","categories":"Art | Talks","coordinates":"40.74166061574600000, -74.00767326355000000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5d0a7887df317.png","pubDate":"Sun, 07 Jul 2019 00:00:05 EDT","pretty_time":"Jul 11 07:00 PM"},{"title":"The Power Is You","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/11/the-power-is-you","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/11/the-power-is-you","description":"<p>Date: July 11, 2019<\/p><p><p>Led by Gary M.

At the boathouse we build, maintain, and row a fleet of traditional wooden rowboats. Our rowing program on the Hudson uses Whitehall Gigs, 25 foot long boats for four rowers which can handle the conditions and traffic of the harbor. We have programs using the smaller boats in Prospect Park in Brooklyn and Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. The boats are traditional handmade wooden rowboats of a variety of designs. Some of them were built at Pier 40 as part of our Community Boatbuilding program.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 4:30 pm<\/p><p>End time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: South end of lake (in Van Cortlandt Park)<\/p>","parkids":"X092","parknames":"Van Cortlandt Park","start":"2019-07-12 16:30:00","end":"2019-07-12 19:00:00","location":"South end of lake (in Van Cortlandt Park)","categories":"Nature | Kayaking and Canoeing","coordinates":"40.88915215898600000, -73.89286369085300000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5cfbcfad32cca.JPG","pubDate":"Sun, 07 Jul 2019 00:00:05 EDT","pretty_time":"Jul 12 04:30 PM"},{"title":"Kayak Staten Island","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/12/kayak-staten-island","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/12/kayak-staten-island","description":"<p>Date: July 12, 2019<\/p><p><p>Join Kayak Staten Island for free public kayaking off the shore at Conference House Park! <\/p>\n\n<p>Boats and life jackets will be provided for a short paddle.

The tour will end with a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most unique features of the park: the 1869 Wellhouse, the park&rsquo;s last remaining building by park designer Calvert Vaux, which once housed the machinery that fueled the  watercourse and was recently restored by the Alliance and converted into the first composting restrooms in a NYC park.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Art & Architecture Tour (3rd Sundays): <\/strong>For over 150 years, Prospect Park has been a showcase for beautiful public buildings and artwork, with representations from eras including Beaux-Arts, City Beautiful, the New Deal Modernism, and contemporary LEED-certified projects.

Boats are available on a first-come-first-served basis, no reservations.<\/p>\n\n<p>Rowing is a beautifully simple, healthy, and empowering sport, and the waters of the lake are an ideal place to pursue its pleasures. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Who can participate:<\/strong><br />\nCommunity rowing is open to all, although some physical agility is required to get in and out of the boats. The focus of the program is recreation in a safe and respectful environment. Each adult must sign a waiver; children must be accompanied by a parent. Life jackets are provided&mdash;and must be worn!<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Volunteers<\/strong> are greatly appreciated! To help with set up, meet at the container in the parking lot south of the lake at 4:00 p.m.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Cost<\/strong><br />\nIt&rsquo;s free. Village Community Boathouse is a nonprofit organization entirely run by volunteers. While no commitment is required from those who row with us, our facilities, boats and equipment require regular upkeep and repair.

At the boathouse we build, maintain, and row a fleet of traditional wooden rowboats. Our rowing program on the Hudson uses Whitehall Gigs, 25 foot long boats for four rowers which can handle the conditions and traffic of the harbor. We have programs using the smaller boats in Prospect Park in Brooklyn and Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. The boats are traditional handmade wooden rowboats of a variety of designs. Some of them were built at Pier 40 as part of our Community Boatbuilding program.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 4:30 pm<\/p><p>End time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: South end of lake (in Van Cortlandt Park)<\/p>","parkids":"X092","parknames":"Van Cortlandt Park","start":"2019-07-19 16:30:00","end":"2019-07-19 19:00:00","location":"South end of lake (in Van Cortlandt Park)","categories":"Nature | Kayaking and Canoeing","coordinates":"40.88915215898600000, -73.89286369085300000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5cfbcfad32cca.JPG","pubDate":"Sun, 07 Jul 2019 00:00:05 EDT","pretty_time":"Jul 19 04:30 PM"},{"title":"Summer Dance Nights","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/19/summer-dance-nights","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/19/summer-dance-nights","description":"<p>Date: July 19, 2019<\/p><p><p>Join us for an evening of dance, fitness and fun!

An invitation to attend a coffee ceremony is considered a mark of friendship or respect and is an excellent example of Ethiopian hospitality.<\/p>\n\n<p>The ceremony is usually conducted by one young woman, dressed in the traditional Ethiopian costume of a white dress with colored woven borders. The long involved process starts with the ceremonial apparatus being arranged upon a bed of long scented grasses. The roasting of the coffee beans is done in a flat pan over a tiny charcoal stove, the pungent smell mingling with the heady scent of frankincense that is always burned during the ceremony. The lady who is conducting the ceremony gently washes a handful of coffee beans on the heated pan, then stirs and shakes the husks away. When the coffee beans have turned black and shining and the aromatic oil is coaxed out of them, they are ground by a pestle and a long-handled mortar. The ground coffee is slowly stirred into the black clay coffee pot locally known as \"jebena\", which is round at the bottom with a straw lid. The coffee is strained through a fine sieve several times. The youngest child is then sent out to announce when it is to be served and stands ready to bring a cup of coffee first to the eldest in the room and then to the others, connecting all the generations.<\/p>\n\n<p>For any questions about this event, please contact Timothy Brown at <a href=\"mailto:Timothybrownnyc@gmail.com\">Timothybrownnyc@gmail.com<\/a> or at (410) 253-7067.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 11:00 am<\/p><p>End time: 3:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (410) 253-7067<\/p><p>Location: Dorothy K.

Prospect Park Alliance and Turnstile Tours host a series of themed walking tours that examine the many layers of natural and human history to be found in Brooklyn&#39;s Backyard. Tours begin at the Brooklyn Public Library at Grand Army Plaza.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Hidden Treasures Tour (1st Sundays):<\/strong> Explore some of the little-known corners of Prospect Park in this tour that uncovers some of the park&rsquo;s hidden treasures. Once prime attractions, these areas are currently the focus of Prospect Park Alliance restoration efforts to revitalize the park. The tour includes the Rose Garden and Vale of Cashmere in the park&rsquo;s northeast corner, and well as a guided walk through Brooklyn&rsquo;s last remaining forest, the 150-acre Ravine.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Waterways & Wellhouse Tour (2nd Sundays): <\/strong>Prospect Park is an engineering marvel, designed around an ingenious drainage system and a chain of manmade streams and ponds that terminate in Brooklyn&rsquo;s largest lake. This tour will follow the park&rsquo;s scenic watercourse and delve into how Prospect Park Alliance maintains and supports this complex system. The tour will end with a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most unique features of the park: the 1869 Wellhouse, the park&rsquo;s last remaining building by park designer Calvert Vaux, which once housed the machinery that fueled the  watercourse and was recently restored by the Alliance and converted into the first composting restrooms in a NYC park.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Art & Architecture Tour (3rd Sundays): <\/strong>For over 150 years, Prospect Park has been a showcase for beautiful public buildings and artwork, with representations from eras including Beaux-Arts, City Beautiful, the New Deal Modernism, and contemporary LEED-certified projects. This tour will examine some of the fine architectural details and ongoing restoration work, from the era of Vaux and Olmsted to the present day.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Brooklyn&rsquo;s Backyard Tour &ndash; includes Zoo and Carousel admission (4th Sundays): <\/strong>Prospect Park is an oasis for people &ndash; and animals! Discover the native habitats and inhabitants of the park, and explore the past and present of recreation, animals, and ongoing conservation efforts of the Prospect Park Alliance.

Roy joined Comedy Central&rsquo;s Emmy-nominated hit series, &ldquo;The Daily Show with Trevor Noah&rdquo; in 2015. In 2017, he was named the new host of Comedy Central&rsquo;s storytelling series, &ldquo;This is Not Happening,&rdquo; which will launch the fifth season next year. His first Comedy Central one-hour stand-up special, &ldquo;Father Figure,&rdquo; premiered in 2017 along with an extended uncensored album of the same name released by Comedy Central Records. His second Comedy Central one-hour stand-up special, &ldquo;Roy Wood Jr.: No One Loves You,&rdquo; premiered at the beginning of 2019 on January 25. Roy Wood Jr. was on Variety&rsquo;s 10 Comics to Watch For list in 2016.<\/p>\n\n<p>Entertainment Weekly has described the thought-provoking comedy of Roy Wood Jr. as &ldquo;charismatic crankiness.&rdquo; Prior to &ldquo;The Daily Show,&rdquo; Wood co-starred for two seasons on TBS&rsquo; &ldquo;Sullivan & Son,&rdquo; playing the loving drinking buddy of star Steve Byrne, who has returned to Pittsburgh to run the family bar. <\/p>\n\n<p>Wood appeared at the Montreal Just for Laughs Comedy Festival in the New Faces Showcase, an appearance that led the Hollywood Reporter to call Roy a \"standout\". He has also been a regular contributor to ESPN&rsquo;s Sports Nation. His first full comedy CD, &#39;Things I Think, I Think,&#39; was released in 2013.<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information, please visit NYLaughs at <a href=\"http://www.nylaughs.org\">nylaughs.org<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About NYLaughs.org<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>NYLaughs.org is a 501(C)3 | Many thanks to our supporters! <\/p>\n\n<p>#LITP 2019 is a passion project run solely by volunteers to enrich NY lives while deepening an appreciation of stand up comedy as a unique NY cultural asset.
