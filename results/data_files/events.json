Callahan will perform 106 Kerri Chandler Chords for voice and computer, a work derived from his project Housed, an archive of (currently) 850 chords from classic House tracks Callahan collected in 2016, which was released on NNA Tapes and is currently being turned into an online archive.<\/p>\n\n<p>Jack Callahan received a BA in Music Composition & Theory from Hampshire College in 2012. He currently curates the concert series Pennies from Heaven in collaboration with Control Synthesizers and Electronic Devices in Brooklyn. In 2018 he coauthored the manifesto <a href=\"http://www.banhmiverlag.com/agave\">Toward Agave Expressionism<\/a> with Alec Sturgis. This lead to the establishment of the festival Neo-Pastiche: Changes in American Music, which will take place in Asheville, NC in April 2019.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now its sixth season, Musical Ecologies is a monthly symposium on music and sound held at the Old Stone House in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Curated and hosted by composer <a href=\"http://danjoseph.org/\">Dan Joseph<\/a>, each event typically focuses on a single artist who presents a work or project either in the form of a talk or lecture, a multimedia presentation, a performance, or combination thereof. Each presentation is preceded by an extended conversation between the artist and curator.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 8:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 10:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: Old Stone House (in J.J.

This weekend-long event will showcase the important contributions of African American soldiers during the American Civil War.<\/p>\n\n<p>Before the Civil War, African Americans were not welcomed into the armed services. That began to change when the Union League in New York City worked to form the United States Colored Troops. The USCT had African-American enlisted men and white officers. Nearly 155 years later, on March 30 and March 31, Historic Richmond Town will host the Hannibal Guards, in honor of this important change. The group is a premier living history organization that shows the lives and duties of local service members during the four-year conflict. Members will present an immersive program to highlight the activities and accomplishments of New York State&rsquo;s three USCT regiments.<\/p>\n\n<p>The program focuses on the service of the 20th USCT and the individuals who served in it. Visitors can experience a mock recruiting station housed in the General Store, where neighbors frequently met each other in the 1860s. There, one can imagine the transformation of citizen farmer, clerk or businessman to solider. The dynamic of a white officer, a black soldier, and the local citizens of the Union League who supported them can be explored fully in this hands-on program.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Experience enlistment as freed people, farmers, school teachers, and artisans become citizen soldiers.<\/li>\n\t<li>Witness the soldiers drill and learn the power of their firearms.<\/li>\n\t<li>Discuss with experts the racial tensions that existed during the mid-part of the 19th century and how those struggles shaped a nation.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/p><p>Start time: 12:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 5:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (718) 351-1611<\/p><p>Location: Historic Richmond Town<\/p>","parkids":"","parknames":"","start":"2019-03-30 12:00:00","end":"2019-03-30 17:00:00","contact_phone":"(718) 351-1611","location":"Historic Richmond Town","categories":"Education | History","coordinates":"40.57006212289800000, -74.14493775367700000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5c6f07bd4a09d.jpg","pubDate":"Thu, 21 Mar 2019 23:59:52 EDT","pretty_time":"Mar 30 12:00 PM"},{"title":"Gardening Workshop: Terrariums","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/03/30/gardening-workshop-terrariums","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/03/30/gardening-workshop-terrariums","description":"<p>Date: March 30, 2019<\/p><p><p>Design and plant a fanciful miniature landscape in a glass container with a selection of diminutive plants, perfect for home or office.

This weekend-long event will showcase the important contributions of African American soldiers during the American Civil War.<\/p>\n\n<p>Before the Civil War, African Americans were not welcomed into the armed services. That began to change when the Union League in New York City worked to form the United States Colored Troops. The USCT had African-American enlisted men and white officers. Nearly 155 years later, on March 30 and March 31, Historic Richmond Town will host the Hannibal Guards, in honor of this important change. The group is a premier living history organization that shows the lives and duties of local service members during the four-year conflict. Members will present an immersive program to highlight the activities and accomplishments of New York State&rsquo;s three USCT regiments.<\/p>\n\n<p>The program focuses on the service of the 20th USCT and the individuals who served in it. Visitors can experience a mock recruiting station housed in the General Store, where neighbors frequently met each other in the 1860s. There, one can imagine the transformation of citizen farmer, clerk or businessman to solider. The dynamic of a white officer, a black soldier, and the local citizens of the Union League who supported them can be explored fully in this hands-on program.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Experience enlistment as freed people, farmers, school teachers, and artisans become citizen soldiers.<\/li>\n\t<li>Witness the soldiers drill and learn the power of their firearms.<\/li>\n\t<li>Discuss with experts the racial tensions that existed during the mid-part of the 19th century and how those struggles shaped a nation.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/p><p>Start time: 12:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 5:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (718) 351-1611<\/p><p>Location: Historic Richmond Town<\/p>","parkids":"","parknames":"","start":"2019-03-31 12:00:00","end":"2019-03-31 17:00:00","contact_phone":"(718) 351-1611","location":"Historic Richmond Town","categories":"Education | History","coordinates":"40.57006212289800000, -74.14493775367700000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5c6f07bd4a09d.jpg","pubDate":"Thu, 21 Mar 2019 23:59:52 EDT","pretty_time":"Mar 31 12:00 PM"},{"title":"Central Park Tour: Iconic Views of Central Park","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/03/31/central-park-tour-iconic-views-of-central-park1","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/03/31/central-park-tour-iconic-views-of-central-park1","description":"<p>Date: March 31, 2019<\/p><p><p>Take our signature tour, and let Central Park Conservancy guides give you an insider&#39;s look at some of the most iconic features of the world&#39;s greatest urban park.

Tunes are those that are typically suitable for contra dancing or other traditional fiddle tunes.<\/p>\n\n<p>This group is intended to provide a musical home for folks interested in playing tunes with other musicians, learning to play by ear and overall increasing their own musical skill. It&rsquo;s fun and welcoming to all ages and levels of playing. While we won&rsquo;t play from sheet music, you can certainly use this as a reference on your own!<br />\n<br />\nWhat do you mean by slow jam? All acoustic instruments (e.g., fiddle, mandolin, guitar, cello, etc.) are welcome and the typical format is that we sit in a circle (or circle-ish, depending on the space) and take turns suggesting/leading a song. The songs will typically follow the AABB format (two &ldquo;A&rdquo; parts followed by two &ldquo;B&rdquo; parts) and we will simply play it over many repeats and if you know it, great, but if you don&rsquo;t, you try to figure it out as we go along, maybe picking up a few notes here and there. We&rsquo;ll play tunes at a slow to moderate speed so that they are accessible to a variety of levels.<br />\n<br />\nIt&rsquo;s fun and can be challenging, but is a great way to improve your playing. You don&rsquo;t have to be a great player, play in tune, or know the songs to give it a shot. If you want to suggest a song, you should either know the song well enough to play it on repeat or we can see if anyone else does!<br />\n <\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 9:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: Old Stone House (in J.J.
