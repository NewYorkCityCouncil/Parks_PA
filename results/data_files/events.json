Trash in the water and on the shore can kill marine animals, injure swimmers and beachgoers, and ensnare boat propellers.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 10:00 am<\/p><p>End time: 4:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (718) 227-1463<\/p><p>Location: Conference House Park Visitor Center (in Conference House Park)<\/p>","parkids":"R006","parknames":"Conference House Park","start":"2019-03-01 10:00:00","end":"2019-03-01 16:00:00","contact_phone":"(718) 227-1463","location":"Conference House Park Visitor Center (in Conference House Park)","categories":"Accessible | Education | Nature | Art | Volunteer","coordinates":"40.50225702965300000, -74.25172543525700000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5b6b1898467f6.jpg","pubDate":"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 23:58:52 EST","pretty_time":"Mar 01 10:00 AM"},{"title":"Easy Rider - Indoor Cycling","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/03/01/easy-rider-indoor-cycling","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/03/01/easy-rider-indoor-cycling","description":"<p>Date: March 1, 2019<\/p><p><p>Ward off the oncoming winter doldrums with small group indoor cycling!<\/p>\n\n<p>Did you love riding bikes as a kid?

He was raised in a family of artists, training his eyes, and honing his creative vision in the inspiring crossroads of suburban and metropolitan. He grew up drawing, later discovered graffiti, earned a degree in Graphic Design and Illustration just over the Verrazano Bridge, at Kingsborough Community College. That is where Mike haphazardly discovered photography. Since then, he&rsquo;s spent the past 16 years self-educating to make photography his &ldquo;Weapon of Choice&rdquo; across all aspects of his life. At 36 years young, Mike Shane uses photography for both personal and professional expression and to share a fresh perspective of the places he so fondly calls HOME.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>All exhibits and programs are located in the Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art (Buildings C & G).

Since 1998, Campbell has used remote control toys, spiky plastic balls, string, GPS tracks, and other non-conventional tools to create works that simultaneously pay homage and parody the great abstract painters of the past. He combines non-traditional and traditional painting methods to create hybrid images.<\/p>\n\n<p>Although the works are abstract in appearance they often suggest elements of nature, fireworks, portals into some unknown world, and influences of other cultures and traditions. They represent movement and are a metaphor for connections that exist in our everyday lives.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>On display March 2 &ndash; May 5, 2019<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Paul Campbell&rsquo;s work has been exhibited extensively in the US and abroad. He has exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum, the Danforth Museum, the Rose Art Museum, Site Santa Fe, and Lesley Heller Gallery in New York. His first major solo show in New York in 1999 was called &ldquo;Remote Control&rdquo; at Roebling Hall Gallery where he showed paintings made with remote control cars. Campbell has received several grants including the Pollock Krasner Foundation Grant and has participated in several international art projects and residencies in Europe, South America, India, Singapore, and China.

Tunes are those that are typically suitable for contra dancing or other traditional fiddle tunes.<\/p>\n\n<p>This group is intended to provide a musical home for folks interested in playing tunes with other musicians, learning to play by ear and overall increasing their own musical skill. It&rsquo;s fun and welcoming to all ages and levels of playing. While we won&rsquo;t play from sheet music, you can certainly use this as a reference on your own!<br />\n<br />\nWhat do you mean by slow jam? All acoustic instruments (e.g., fiddle, mandolin, guitar, cello, etc.) are welcome and the typical format is that we sit in a circle (or circle-ish, depending on the space) and take turns suggesting/leading a song. The songs will typically follow the AABB format (two &ldquo;A&rdquo; parts followed by two &ldquo;B&rdquo; parts) and we will simply play it over many repeats and if you know it, great, but if you don&rsquo;t, you try to figure it out as we go along, maybe picking up a few notes here and there. We&rsquo;ll play tunes at a slow to moderate speed so that they are accessible to a variety of levels.<br />\n<br />\nIt&rsquo;s fun and can be challenging, but is a great way to improve your playing. You don&rsquo;t have to be a great player, play in tune, or know the songs to give it a shot. If you want to suggest a song, you should either know the song well enough to play it on repeat or we can see if anyone else does!<br />\n <\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 9:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: Old Stone House (in J.J.

And, it&#39;s an affordable way to increase physical activity opportunities, because there&#39;s nothing special to build.<\/p>\n\n<p>Come to Fort Tryon Park and try something new. Join us on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday mornings for one hour of walking, stretching, and strengthening exercises.<\/p>\n\n<p>All of our fitness programs are free, led by trained professionals, and suitable for all levels. Wear comfortable clothing and bring water. <\/p>\n\n<p>Exercising with a view, in natural sunlight, with green scenery all around bestow health benefits that can&rsquo;t be found indoors.

Matangi/Maya/M.I.A is a biographical documentary film about the inspiring life of British-Sri Lankan singer/songwriter, rapper, producer, and political activist Matangi Arulpragasam, better known as M.I.A. <\/p>\n\n<p>In 2007, M.I.A. became an international name with her Grammy-nominated song \"Paper Planes\", which topped charts worldwide. Steve Loveridge, a longtime friend and associate of M.I.A, used an intriguing non-linear style approach to the documentary which profiles her life going forward and backward.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Using over two decades of archival footage provided by M.I.A herself, Loveridge captures her journey and personal growth in her music, immigrant/refugee experiences, and political activism. Together, M.I.A and Loveridge bring you through the first hand experiences of what it means to be the daughter of a Tamil resistance fighter during the Sri Lankan Civil War, a refugee, an immigrant, and a musical star. The film displays M.I.A&#39;s multi-cultural and artistic identities as she shares her thoughts and feelings as a first-generation immigrant/refugee and how it has impacted her life.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 2:30 pm<\/p><p>End time: 4:30 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (718) 939-0647<\/p><p>Location: Kingsland Homestead (in Margaret I.

A New York-based ensemble, Duo Vivace grew out of four-hand collaborations by Susan Sobolewski and Eleonor Bindman, who were students of Vladimir Feltsman and frequent performers in his master classes at SUNY&mdash;The College at New Paltz. Duo Vivace inaugurated its performing career with a four-hand recital debut at Carnegie (Weill) Recital Hall in New York City in 1993.<\/p>\n\n<p>Duo Vivace has since performed and presented master classes at such venues as Barnard College, Westminster Choir College, Ithaca College, Nassau Community College, Ramapo College, the Kleinert-James Gallery, Rutgers University, Merkin Hall and Steinway Hall. The duo has also been guest artists at summer festivals such as the Piano Institute at SUNY New Paltz, the Palisades Arts Festival, the Festival of Performances (Bethlehem, PA), and Music in the Mountains.<\/p>\n\n<p>In 1995, after its critically acclaimed New York two-piano debut, Duo Vivace was invited to perform at the First International Duo-Piano Festival in Quebec, Canada. More recent performances include a live radio appearance on WAMC in Albany and the world premiere of the four-hand version of Robert Starer&rsquo;s Concerto for Two Pianos with the Hudson Valley Philharmonic under the baton of Jo Ann Falletta.
