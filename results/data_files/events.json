Seventeen artists were asked to envision monuments that add depth and truth to New York&rsquo;s compelling history.<\/p>\n\n<p>Quotations from historical documents that correspond to exhibiting monuments will be displayed alongside the artists&rsquo; work to reveal their relevance.<br />\nArtists were selected through an open call. They were invited to draw from a list of contentious monuments, sites, and individuals, but could also suggest a topic that inspired them. Their proposals showed concern for language, prominence, place, transformation, and reconciliation. These imagined monuments are an opportunity for artists to access all of New York City&rsquo;s complexities and to honor how its challenging past has shaped the city into the diverse, energetic, thriving, creative mega-destination that it is today.<\/p>\n\n<p>Through drawings, quilts, interactive sculptural pieces, and paintings the artists are more interested in creating inclusive, dimensional histories than in erecting massive symbols with a limited perspective, addressing often debated figures such as Christopher Columbus and George Washington. They also offer insight into how collective thinking has shaped New York&#39;s story. What we learn and understand shapes how we remember the past. Curated by Katie Fuller, Reimagining Monuments becomes an incubator for creative responses to these challenging questions.<\/p>\n\n<p>The exhibit builds on Fuller&rsquo;s Race and Revolution arts education series which aims to bring the conversation of past racism into the present. The interpretive nature of art allows a viewer to respond in a personal way, while the language of historical documents speaks to the facts. The two-act in dialogue, communicating patterns of systemic racism and white supremacy.<\/p>\n\n<p>Exhibiting artists include Alexis Callender, Ayasha Guerin, Chip Thomas, Damien Davis, Emmaline Payette, Kamau Ware, Kimberly Becoat, Lyra Monteiro, Maureen Conner, Maureen McNeil, Marilyn Nance, Rose Desiano, Sal Munoz, Studio Darn, Zaq Landsberg and Jennifer Mack Watkins.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Image: \"Robes\" by DARNstudio<br />\nMaterials: custom-printed matchbooks, felt, thread<\/em><\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 6:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 9:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: Old Stone House (in J.J.
