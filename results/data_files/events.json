Typical chores such as churning butter, cooking, gathering wood, and hauling water are all part of the full History Camp experience. Children will also travel in time back to the early years of the Revolutionary War and experience the life of a soldier in General George Washington&rsquo;s army. They will lend a hand with pitching tents and setting up camp. &ldquo;Enlistment&rdquo; in the army, military drill, and reconnaissance are also part of the action.<\/p>\n\n<p>The camp is lead by Van Cortlandt House Museum&rsquo;s professional staff, talented living history volunteers, and college students studying material culture and history. Daily activities for  Adventures in Time Summer History Camp are designed in keeping with New York State 4th grade curriculum standards and are appropriate for children ages 6 - 12.  Campers bring their own lunches but Van Cortlandt House Museum provides daily snacks and drinking water.   Adventures in Time is a technology-free experience. Campers may bring a cell phone with them to camp but all phones will be left with the administrative staff in the Welcome Center/Office during camp hours. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Registration<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>We encourage early enrollment, as camp space is limited and enrolls on a first-come, first-served basis.

At the boathouse we build, maintain, and row a fleet of traditional wooden rowboats. Our rowing program on the Hudson uses Whitehall Gigs, 25 foot long boats for four rowers which can handle the conditions and traffic of the harbor. We have programs using the smaller boats in Prospect Park in Brooklyn and Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. The boats are traditional handmade wooden rowboats of a variety of designs.

The tour will end with a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most unique features of the park: the 1869 Wellhouse, the park&rsquo;s last remaining building by park designer Calvert Vaux, which once housed the machinery that fueled the  watercourse and was recently restored by the Alliance and converted into the first composting restrooms in a NYC park.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Art & Architecture Tour (3rd Sundays): <\/strong>For over 150 years, Prospect Park has been a showcase for beautiful public buildings and artwork, with representations from eras including Beaux-Arts, City Beautiful, the New Deal Modernism, and contemporary LEED-certified projects.

Additional support is provided by the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs and the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York State Legislature.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 9:00 am<\/p><p>End time: 5:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 360-8163<\/p><p>Location: Arsenal (in Central Park)<\/p>","parkids":"M010","parknames":"Central Park","start":"2019-08-29 09:00:00","end":"2019-08-29 17:00:00","contact_phone":"(212) 360-8163","location":"Arsenal (in Central Park)","categories":"Accessible | Art | History | Seniors","coordinates":"40.76720046997100000, -73.97129821777300000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5cf68d2f78c67.jpeg","pubDate":"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 00:00:19 EDT","pretty_time":"Aug 29 09:00 AM"},{"title":"Summer on the Hudson: Super Soccer Stars","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/08/29/summer-on-the-hudson-super-soccer-stars","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/08/29/summer-on-the-hudson-super-soccer-stars","description":"<p>Date: August 29, 2019<\/p><p><p>Children 5 years old and younger learn soccer skills with <a href=\"http://newyork.supersoccerstars.com/\">Super Soccer Stars<\/a> in a fun, non-competitive, educational environment to build self-confidence and to develop teamwork.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 9:30 am<\/p><p>End time: 10:30 am<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 870-3070<\/p><p>Location: 72nd Track and Lawn (in Riverside Park)<\/p>","parkids":"M072","parknames":"Riverside Park","start":"2019-08-29 09:30:00","end":"2019-08-29 10:30:00","contact_phone":"(212) 870-3070","location":"72nd Track and Lawn (in Riverside Park)","categories":"Best for Kids | Sports | Waterfront","coordinates":"40.78228759765625000, -73.98698425292969000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5c7d6e458e116.jpg","pubDate":"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 00:00:19 EDT","pretty_time":"Aug 29 09:30 AM"},{"title":"Kids Yoga with Sacred Sounds Yoga in Washington Square Park","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/08/29/kids-yoga-with-sacred-sounds-yoga","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/08/29/kids-yoga-with-sacred-sounds-yoga","description":"<p>Date: August 29, 2019<\/p><p><p>Kids can join in the yoga fun as they stretch and move to songs, rhymes, and more with Sacred Sounds Yoga.

At the boathouse we build, maintain, and row a fleet of traditional wooden rowboats. Our rowing program on the Hudson uses Whitehall Gigs, 25 foot long boats for four rowers which can handle the conditions and traffic of the harbor. We have programs using the smaller boats in Prospect Park in Brooklyn and Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. The boats are traditional handmade wooden rowboats of a variety of designs. Some of them were built at Pier 40 as part of our Community Boatbuilding program.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 4:30 pm<\/p><p>End time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: South end of lake (in Van Cortlandt Park)<\/p>","parkids":"X092","parknames":"Van Cortlandt Park","start":"2019-08-30 16:30:00","end":"2019-08-30 19:00:00","location":"South end of lake (in Van Cortlandt Park)","categories":"Nature | Kayaking and Canoeing","coordinates":"40.88915215898600000, -73.89286369085300000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5cfbcfad32cca.JPG","pubDate":"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 00:00:19 EDT","pretty_time":"Aug 30 04:30 PM"},{"title":"Summer on the Hudson: Breathing with Strangers Presented by Kinesis Project Dance Theatre","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/08/30/summer-on-the-hudson-breathing-with-strangers-presented-by-kinesis-project-dance-theatre","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/08/30/summer-on-the-hudson-breathing-with-strangers-presented-by-kinesis-project-dance-theatre","description":"<p>Date: August 30, 2019<\/p><p><p>Melissa Riker and <a href=\"https://kinesisproject.squarespace.com/\">Kinesis Project Dance Theatre<\/a> presents the site-specific company&rsquo;s newest large-scale outdoor dance performance&mdash;a ragged, sweeping and surprising love-song to New York City.

Prospect Park Alliance and Turnstile Tours host a series of themed walking tours that examine the many layers of natural and human history to be found in Brooklyn&#39;s Backyard. Tours begin at the Brooklyn Public Library at Grand Army Plaza.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Hidden Treasures Tour (1st Sundays):<\/strong> Explore some of the little-known corners of Prospect Park in this tour that uncovers some of the park&rsquo;s hidden treasures. Once prime attractions, these areas are currently the focus of Prospect Park Alliance restoration efforts to revitalize the park.

This tour will follow the park&rsquo;s scenic watercourse and delve into how Prospect Park Alliance maintains and supports this complex system. The tour will end with a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most unique features of the park: the 1869 Wellhouse, the park&rsquo;s last remaining building by park designer Calvert Vaux, which once housed the machinery that fueled the  watercourse and was recently restored by the Alliance and converted into the first composting restrooms in a NYC park.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Art & Architecture Tour (3rd Sundays): <\/strong>For over 150 years, Prospect Park has been a showcase for beautiful public buildings and artwork, with representations from eras including Beaux-Arts, City Beautiful, the New Deal Modernism, and contemporary LEED-certified projects. This tour will examine some of the fine architectural details and ongoing restoration work, from the era of Vaux and Olmsted to the present day.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Brooklyn&rsquo;s Backyard Tour &ndash; includes Zoo and Carousel admission (4th Sundays): <\/strong>Prospect Park is an oasis for people &ndash; and animals!

Tunes are those that are typically suitable for contra dancing or other traditional fiddle tunes.<\/p>\n\n<p>This group is intended to provide a musical home for folks interested in playing tunes with other musicians, learning to play by ear and overall increasing their own musical skill. It&rsquo;s fun and welcoming to all ages and levels of playing. While we won&rsquo;t play from sheet music, you can certainly use this as a reference on your own!<br />\n<br />\nWhat do you mean by slow jam? All acoustic instruments (e.g., fiddle, mandolin, guitar, cello, etc.) are welcome and the typical format is that we sit in a circle (or circle-ish, depending on the space) and take turns suggesting/leading a song. The songs will typically follow the AABB format (two &ldquo;A&rdquo; parts followed by two &ldquo;B&rdquo; parts) and we will simply play it over many repeats and if you know it, great, but if you don&rsquo;t, you try to figure it out as we go along, maybe picking up a few notes here and there. We&rsquo;ll play tunes at a slow to moderate speed so that they are accessible to a variety of levels.<br />\n<br />\nIt&rsquo;s fun and can be challenging, but is a great way to improve your playing. You don&rsquo;t have to be a great player, play in tune, or know the songs to give it a shot. If you want to suggest a song, you should either know the song well enough to play it on repeat or we can see if anyone else does!<br />\n <\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 9:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: Old Stone House (in J.J.
