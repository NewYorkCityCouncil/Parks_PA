Some of the fish living in the Meer include largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, bluegill sunfish, carp, and chain pickerel.<\/p>\n\n<p>Fishing poles are available to borrow at the <a href=\"http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/charles-a-dana-discovery-center.html\">Charles A.

This event is free; registration is not required.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Fishing Guidelines:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Release fish gently. All fishing is on a \"catch-and-release\" basis only, meaning that all fish caught must be put back into the water immediately.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please wet your hands before handling fish, and release while the fish is underwater if possible.<\/p>\n\n<p>Use safe fishing equipment. The use of barbs on hooks, lead sinkers and overhead casting rods is strictly prohibited. Monofilament line should be properly discarded of in the Charles A. Dana Discovery Center to avoid harming wildlife.<\/p>\n\n<p>Respect the turtles and waterfowl. If you see a turtle or bird near your hook, please move to another spot to avoid catching it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please fish with complimentary fish bait (corn kernels) from the Dana Center ONLY. The use of bread products and hot dogs as bait is discouraged as it has been found to be harmful to both the wildlife and the water bodies.<\/p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t feed the wildlife. Feeding any other wildlife and digging for worms is strictly prohibited.<\/p>\n\n<p>Stay on pathways, ramps, and steps next to the water. Excessive trampling of the natural shoreline and wading in the water kills the grass and causes soil erosion and compaction. This creates poor living conditions for plants, fish and other Meer dwellers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Visitors over age 16 using their own fishing equipment must have a fishing license. Visitors using equipment from the Dana Center do not need a fishing license.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 11:00 am<\/p><p>End time: 4:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 310-6600<\/p><p>Location: Charles A.

This weekend-long event will showcase the important contributions of African American soldiers during the American Civil War.<\/p>\n\n<p>Before the Civil War, African Americans were not welcomed into the armed services. That began to change when the Union League in New York City worked to form the United States Colored Troops. The USCT had African-American enlisted men and white officers. Nearly 155 years later, on March 30 and March 31, Historic Richmond Town will host the Hannibal Guards, in honor of this important change. The group is a premier living history organization that shows the lives and duties of local service members during the four-year conflict. Members will present an immersive program to highlight the activities and accomplishments of New York State&rsquo;s three USCT regiments.<\/p>\n\n<p>The program focuses on the service of the 20th USCT and the individuals who served in it. Visitors can experience a mock recruiting station housed in the General Store, where neighbors frequently met each other in the 1860s. There, one can imagine the transformation of citizen farmer, clerk or businessman to solider. The dynamic of a white officer, a black soldier, and the local citizens of the Union League who supported them can be explored fully in this hands-on program.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Experience enlistment as freed people, farmers, school teachers, and artisans become citizen soldiers.<\/li>\n\t<li>Witness the soldiers drill and learn the power of their firearms.<\/li>\n\t<li>Discuss with experts the racial tensions that existed during the mid-part of the 19th century and how those struggles shaped a nation.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/p><p>Start time: 12:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 5:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (718) 351-1611<\/p><p>Location: Historic Richmond Town<\/p>","parkids":"","parknames":"","start":"2019-03-30 12:00:00","end":"2019-03-30 17:00:00","contact_phone":"(718) 351-1611","location":"Historic Richmond Town","categories":"Education | History","coordinates":"40.57006212289800000, -74.14493775367700000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5c6f07bd4a09d.jpg","pubDate":"Sat, 16 Mar 2019 23:59:59 EDT","pretty_time":"Mar 30 12:00 PM"},{"title":"Gardening Workshop: Terrariums","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/03/30/gardening-workshop-terrariums","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/03/30/gardening-workshop-terrariums","description":"<p>Date: March 30, 2019<\/p><p><p>Design and plant a fanciful miniature landscape in a glass container with a selection of diminutive plants, perfect for home or office.
