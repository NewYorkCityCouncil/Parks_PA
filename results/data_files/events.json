Boats are available on a first-come-first-served basis, no reservations.<\/p>\n\n<p>Rowing is a beautifully simple, healthy, and empowering sport, and the waters of the lake are an ideal place to pursue its pleasures. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Who can participate:<\/strong><br />\nCommunity rowing is open to all, although some physical agility is required to get in and out of the boats. The focus of the program is recreation in a safe and respectful environment. Each adult must sign a waiver; children must be accompanied by a parent. Life jackets are provided&mdash;and must be worn!<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Volunteers<\/strong> are greatly appreciated! To help with set up, meet at the container in the parking lot south of the lake at 4:00 p.m.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Cost<\/strong><br />\nIt&rsquo;s free.

At the boathouse we build, maintain, and row a fleet of traditional wooden rowboats. Our rowing program on the Hudson uses Whitehall Gigs, 25 foot long boats for four rowers which can handle the conditions and traffic of the harbor. We have programs using the smaller boats in Prospect Park in Brooklyn and Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. The boats are traditional handmade wooden rowboats of a variety of designs. Some of them were built at Pier 40 as part of our Community Boatbuilding program.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 4:30 pm<\/p><p>End time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: South end of lake (in Van Cortlandt Park)<\/p>","parkids":"X092","parknames":"Van Cortlandt Park","start":"2019-08-30 16:30:00","end":"2019-08-30 19:00:00","location":"South end of lake (in Van Cortlandt Park)","categories":"Nature | Kayaking and Canoeing","coordinates":"40.88915215898600000, -73.89286369085300000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5cfbcfad32cca.JPG","pubDate":"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 23:59:52 EDT","pretty_time":"Aug 30 04:30 PM"},{"title":"Summer Dance Nights: Line Dance","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/08/30/summer-dance-nights-line-dancehiphopsoca","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/08/30/summer-dance-nights-line-dancehiphopsoca","description":"<p>Date: August 30, 2019<\/p><p><p>Join us for an evening of dance, fitness and fun!

Prospect Park Alliance and Turnstile Tours host a series of themed walking tours that examine the many layers of natural and human history to be found in Brooklyn&#39;s Backyard. Tours begin at the Brooklyn Public Library at Grand Army Plaza.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Hidden Treasures Tour (1st Sundays):<\/strong> Explore some of the little-known corners of Prospect Park in this tour that uncovers some of the park&rsquo;s hidden treasures. Once prime attractions, these areas are currently the focus of Prospect Park Alliance restoration efforts to revitalize the park. The tour includes the Rose Garden and Vale of Cashmere in the park&rsquo;s northeast corner, and well as a guided walk through Brooklyn&rsquo;s last remaining forest, the 150-acre Ravine.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Waterways & Wellhouse Tour (2nd Sundays): <\/strong>Prospect Park is an engineering marvel, designed around an ingenious drainage system and a chain of manmade streams and ponds that terminate in Brooklyn&rsquo;s largest lake. This tour will follow the park&rsquo;s scenic watercourse and delve into how Prospect Park Alliance maintains and supports this complex system. The tour will end with a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most unique features of the park: the 1869 Wellhouse, the park&rsquo;s last remaining building by park designer Calvert Vaux, which once housed the machinery that fueled the  watercourse and was recently restored by the Alliance and converted into the first composting restrooms in a NYC park.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Art & Architecture Tour (3rd Sundays): <\/strong>For over 150 years, Prospect Park has been a showcase for beautiful public buildings and artwork, with representations from eras including Beaux-Arts, City Beautiful, the New Deal Modernism, and contemporary LEED-certified projects. This tour will examine some of the fine architectural details and ongoing restoration work, from the era of Vaux and Olmsted to the present day.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Brooklyn&rsquo;s Backyard Tour &ndash; includes Zoo and Carousel admission (4th Sundays): <\/strong>Prospect Park is an oasis for people &ndash; and animals! Discover the native habitats and inhabitants of the park, and explore the past and present of recreation, animals, and ongoing conservation efforts of the Prospect Park Alliance. This tour includes an interactive scavenger for children and adults, and ends at the park&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Corner, with a special visit to Prospect Park Zoo and tickets to ride the historic Carousel.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.prospectpark.org/visit-the-park/things-to-do/tours/\">Learn more and get tickets today<\/a>!<\/strong><\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 10:30 am<\/p><p>End time: 12:30 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: Prospect Park<\/p>","parkids":"B073","parknames":"Prospect Park","start":"2019-09-01 10:30:00","end":"2019-09-01 12:30:00","location":"Prospect Park","categories":"Art | History | Tours","coordinates":"40.66170120239258000, -73.97080230712890000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5c9a84bce58c9.JPG","pubDate":"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 23:59:52 EDT","pretty_time":"Sep 01 10:30 AM"},{"title":"Summer on the Hudson: 27th Annual Great North River Tugboat Race","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/09/01/summer-on-the-hudson-27th-annual-great-north-river-tugboat-race","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/09/01/summer-on-the-hudson-27th-annual-great-north-river-tugboat-race","description":"<p>Date: September 1, 2019<\/p><p><p>Join us for the start of the annual <a href=\"http://workingharbor.org/\">Working Harbor Committee<\/a> Tugboat Race!

Tunes are those that are typically suitable for contra dancing or other traditional fiddle tunes.<\/p>\n\n<p>This group is intended to provide a musical home for folks interested in playing tunes with other musicians, learning to play by ear and overall increasing their own musical skill. It&rsquo;s fun and welcoming to all ages and levels of playing. While we won&rsquo;t play from sheet music, you can certainly use this as a reference on your own!<br />\n<br />\nWhat do you mean by slow jam? All acoustic instruments (e.g., fiddle, mandolin, guitar, cello, etc.) are welcome and the typical format is that we sit in a circle (or circle-ish, depending on the space) and take turns suggesting/leading a song. The songs will typically follow the AABB format (two &ldquo;A&rdquo; parts followed by two &ldquo;B&rdquo; parts) and we will simply play it over many repeats and if you know it, great, but if you don&rsquo;t, you try to figure it out as we go along, maybe picking up a few notes here and there. We&rsquo;ll play tunes at a slow to moderate speed so that they are accessible to a variety of levels.<br />\n<br />\nIt&rsquo;s fun and can be challenging, but is a great way to improve your playing. You don&rsquo;t have to be a great player, play in tune, or know the songs to give it a shot. If you want to suggest a song, you should either know the song well enough to play it on repeat or we can see if anyone else does!<br />\n <\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 9:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: Old Stone House (in J.J.

Prospect Park Alliance and Turnstile Tours host a series of themed walking tours that examine the many layers of natural and human history to be found in Brooklyn&#39;s Backyard. Tours begin at the Brooklyn Public Library at Grand Army Plaza.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Hidden Treasures Tour (1st Sundays):<\/strong> Explore some of the little-known corners of Prospect Park in this tour that uncovers some of the park&rsquo;s hidden treasures. Once prime attractions, these areas are currently the focus of Prospect Park Alliance restoration efforts to revitalize the park. The tour includes the Rose Garden and Vale of Cashmere in the park&rsquo;s northeast corner, and well as a guided walk through Brooklyn&rsquo;s last remaining forest, the 150-acre Ravine.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Waterways & Wellhouse Tour (2nd Sundays): <\/strong>Prospect Park is an engineering marvel, designed around an ingenious drainage system and a chain of manmade streams and ponds that terminate in Brooklyn&rsquo;s largest lake. This tour will follow the park&rsquo;s scenic watercourse and delve into how Prospect Park Alliance maintains and supports this complex system. The tour will end with a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most unique features of the park: the 1869 Wellhouse, the park&rsquo;s last remaining building by park designer Calvert Vaux, which once housed the machinery that fueled the  watercourse and was recently restored by the Alliance and converted into the first composting restrooms in a NYC park.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Art & Architecture Tour (3rd Sundays): <\/strong>For over 150 years, Prospect Park has been a showcase for beautiful public buildings and artwork, with representations from eras including Beaux-Arts, City Beautiful, the New Deal Modernism, and contemporary LEED-certified projects. This tour will examine some of the fine architectural details and ongoing restoration work, from the era of Vaux and Olmsted to the present day.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Brooklyn&rsquo;s Backyard Tour &ndash; includes Zoo and Carousel admission (4th Sundays): <\/strong>Prospect Park is an oasis for people &ndash; and animals! Discover the native habitats and inhabitants of the park, and explore the past and present of recreation, animals, and ongoing conservation efforts of the Prospect Park Alliance. This tour includes an interactive scavenger for children and adults, and ends at the park&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Corner, with a special visit to Prospect Park Zoo and tickets to ride the historic Carousel.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.prospectpark.org/visit-the-park/things-to-do/tours/\">Learn more and get tickets today<\/a>!<\/strong><\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 10:30 am<\/p><p>End time: 12:30 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: Prospect Park<\/p>","parkids":"B073","parknames":"Prospect Park","start":"2019-09-08 10:30:00","end":"2019-09-08 12:30:00","location":"Prospect Park","categories":"Art | History | Tours","coordinates":"40.66170120239258000, -73.97080230712890000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5c9a84bce58c9.JPG","pubDate":"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 23:59:52 EDT","pretty_time":"Sep 08 10:30 AM"},{"title":"Grandparents Day Celebration","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/09/08/grandparents-day-celebration","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/09/08/grandparents-day-celebration","description":"<p>Date: September 8, 2019<\/p><p><p>Spend a special day with Grandma or Grandpa!
