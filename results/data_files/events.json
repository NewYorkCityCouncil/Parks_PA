The tour will end with a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most unique features of the park: the 1869 Wellhouse, the park&rsquo;s last remaining building by park designer Calvert Vaux, which once housed the machinery that fueled the  watercourse and was recently restored by the Alliance and converted into the first composting restrooms in a NYC park.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Art & Architecture Tour (3rd Sundays): <\/strong>For over 150 years, Prospect Park has been a showcase for beautiful public buildings and artwork, with representations from eras including Beaux-Arts, City Beautiful, the New Deal Modernism, and contemporary LEED-certified projects.

Tunes are those that are typically suitable for contra dancing or other traditional fiddle tunes.<\/p>\n\n<p>This group is intended to provide a musical home for folks interested in playing tunes with other musicians, learning to play by ear and overall increasing their own musical skill. It&rsquo;s fun and welcoming to all ages and levels of playing. While we won&rsquo;t play from sheet music, you can certainly use this as a reference on your own!<br />\n<br />\nWhat do you mean by slow jam? All acoustic instruments (e.g., fiddle, mandolin, guitar, cello, etc.) are welcome and the typical format is that we sit in a circle (or circle-ish, depending on the space) and take turns suggesting/leading a song. The songs will typically follow the AABB format (two &ldquo;A&rdquo; parts followed by two &ldquo;B&rdquo; parts) and we will simply play it over many repeats and if you know it, great, but if you don&rsquo;t, you try to figure it out as we go along, maybe picking up a few notes here and there. We&rsquo;ll play tunes at a slow to moderate speed so that they are accessible to a variety of levels.<br />\n<br />\nIt&rsquo;s fun and can be challenging, but is a great way to improve your playing. You don&rsquo;t have to be a great player, play in tune, or know the songs to give it a shot. If you want to suggest a song, you should either know the song well enough to play it on repeat or we can see if anyone else does!<br />\n <\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 9:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: Old Stone House (in J.J.

After moving to New York and spending years in the salsa scene here, he formed Grupo Ir&eacute;k with Hensy Perez, Tosso Hettinger, and Heriberto Valentin, and made his first recording as a bandleader with them in 2008. It was during this period that Grupo Ir&eacute;k became one of the best-known and most respected Salsa acts on the New York City circuit. Chino also began playing every year at the Vanidades Magazine anniversary party&mdash;previously honoring such classic entertainers as Gloria Estefan, Paquito de Rivera, Ruben Blades, and Juan Luis Guerra. In 2013, Chino toured in Japan, playing at the Cuban Japan festival. Since then, he has built up quite a following among Japanese fans of Salsa music.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Sunset Wednesday Concerts<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Sunset Wednesdays offer a series of seven lively outdoor concerts on the Great Lawn overlooking the Hudson River.

At the boathouse we build, maintain, and row a fleet of traditional wooden rowboats. Our rowing program on the Hudson uses Whitehall Gigs, 25 foot long boats for four rowers which can handle the conditions and traffic of the harbor. We have programs using the smaller boats in Prospect Park in Brooklyn and Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. The boats are traditional handmade wooden rowboats of a variety of designs. Some of them were built at Pier 40 as part of our Community Boatbuilding program.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 4:30 pm<\/p><p>End time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: South end of lake (in Van Cortlandt Park)<\/p>","parkids":"X092","parknames":"Van Cortlandt Park","start":"2019-08-09 16:30:00","end":"2019-08-09 19:00:00","location":"South end of lake (in Van Cortlandt Park)","categories":"Nature | Kayaking and Canoeing","coordinates":"40.88915215898600000, -73.89286369085300000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5cfbcfad32cca.JPG","pubDate":"Thu, 01 Aug 2019 00:00:19 EDT","pretty_time":"Aug 09 04:30 PM"},{"title":"Kayak Staten Island","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/08/09/kayak-staten-island","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/08/09/kayak-staten-island","description":"<p>Date: August 9, 2019<\/p><p><p>Join Kayak Staten Island for free public kayaking off the shore at Conference House Park! <\/p>\n\n<p>Boats and life jackets will be provided for a short paddle.

You&rsquo;ll hear why when this lively quartet takes Brazilian folk music and shakes it up with the flatpicking guitars and fiery fiddles of American bluegrass to create a musical experience Matuto likens to &ldquo;Brazilian Carnival in the Appalachian Mountains.&rdquo; Anchored by the guitar of Clay Ross and accordion of Rob Curto, Matuto&rsquo;s joyous explorations of every folk, world, and jazz style are invigorating.<\/p>\n\n<p>Consider every possibility for what&rsquo;s exciting and daring in Irish fiddle playing and <strong>Eileen Ivers<\/strong> surpasses them. This Grammy Award winner, Emmy nominated, and nine-time All-Ireland Fiddle Champion has played with major orchestras around the globe as well as such luminaries as Sting, the Chieftains, Patti Smith, and countless others. Called &ldquo;the Jimi Hendrix of the violin&rdquo; (The New York Times), she is deeply rooted in tradition while remaining dedicated to exploring new possibilities for the instrument.<\/p>\n\n<p>Zydeco, that intoxicating accordion-driven South Louisiana-rooted blend of Cajun, Afro-Caribbean, and African-American popular music, burns brightly when <strong>Nathan and the Zydeco Cha Chas <\/strong>perform. Nathan Williams&rsquo;s accordion playing sets the boisterous tone while his brother Dennis&rsquo;s jazz-tinged guitar brings a unique flavor to the music. Bass, drums, and rubboard add extra spice to this Louisiana-styled musical gumbo for a performance that will get your feet moving, fingers snapping, and heart-pounding.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Photo Credit: Angelito Jusay.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>As part of Picnic Performances presented by Bank of America, this event is free and open to the public with no tickets and no lines.

Their songs often seek out dark lairs within which terrible monsters dwell, but Their mission is to retrieve the treasure from the dark lair & persuade the terrible monsters inside to seek out the path of redemption. As Axl Rose once memorably asked, in the song \"terrible monster\": \"what&#39;s so terrible about monsters, anyway?\" This is the question the Mountain Goats have been doggedly pursuing since 1991.

Typical chores such as churning butter, cooking, gathering wood, and hauling water are all part of the full History Camp experience. Children will also travel in time back to the early years of the Revolutionary War and experience the life of a soldier in General George Washington&rsquo;s army. They will lend a hand with pitching tents and setting up camp. &ldquo;Enlistment&rdquo; in the army, military drill, and reconnaissance are also part of the action.<\/p>\n\n<p>The camp is lead by Van Cortlandt House Museum&rsquo;s professional staff, talented living history volunteers, and college students studying material culture and history. Daily activities for  Adventures in Time Summer History Camp are designed in keeping with New York State 4th grade curriculum standards and are appropriate for children ages 6 - 12.  Campers bring their own lunches but Van Cortlandt House Museum provides daily snacks and drinking water.   Adventures in Time is a technology-free experience. Campers may bring a cell phone with them to camp but all phones will be left with the administrative staff in the Welcome Center/Office during camp hours. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Registration<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>We encourage early enrollment, as camp space is limited and enrolls on a first-come, first-served basis.

Typical chores such as churning butter, cooking, gathering wood, and hauling water are all part of the full History Camp experience. Children will also travel in time back to the early years of the Revolutionary War and experience the life of a soldier in General George Washington&rsquo;s army. They will lend a hand with pitching tents and setting up camp. &ldquo;Enlistment&rdquo; in the army, military drill, and reconnaissance are also part of the action.<\/p>\n\n<p>The camp is lead by Van Cortlandt House Museum&rsquo;s professional staff, talented living history volunteers, and college students studying material culture and history. Daily activities for  Adventures in Time Summer History Camp are designed in keeping with New York State 4th grade curriculum standards and are appropriate for children ages 6 - 12.  Campers bring their own lunches but Van Cortlandt House Museum provides daily snacks and drinking water.   Adventures in Time is a technology-free experience. Campers may bring a cell phone with them to camp but all phones will be left with the administrative staff in the Welcome Center/Office during camp hours. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Registration<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>We encourage early enrollment, as camp space is limited and enrolls on a first-come, first-served basis.

Typical chores such as churning butter, cooking, gathering wood, and hauling water are all part of the full History Camp experience. Children will also travel in time back to the early years of the Revolutionary War and experience the life of a soldier in General George Washington&rsquo;s army. They will lend a hand with pitching tents and setting up camp. &ldquo;Enlistment&rdquo; in the army, military drill, and reconnaissance are also part of the action.<\/p>\n\n<p>The camp is lead by Van Cortlandt House Museum&rsquo;s professional staff, talented living history volunteers, and college students studying material culture and history. Daily activities for  Adventures in Time Summer History Camp are designed in keeping with New York State 4th grade curriculum standards and are appropriate for children ages 6 - 12.

There are shades of both Bu&ntilde;uel and Pinter in La Ci&eacute;naga (The Swamp), a densely atmospheric film whose sensibility balances precariously between black humor and palpable foreboding. Two large families &ndash; complete with middle-aged boozers, noisy children, oppressed servants, and pets &ndash; spend a torpid summer in a faded resort town. Soon the rough-and-tumble domestic situation strains everyone&rsquo;s nerves and repressed family mysteries are exposed as this long, hot summer threatens to erupt into violence.

The son of Byron Lye-Fook, a studio musician and drummer who worked with the likes of Bob Marley and the Rolling Stones, Omar was classically trained at London&#39;s Guildhall School of Music, and plays the trumpet, piano and percussion. Considered by some to be the &#39;father&#39; of British neo soul, his throwback sound appeared to be ahead of its time, proving to be more influential in the canon than on the charts&mdash;he counts India.Arie, Erykah Badu, and his idol, Stevie Wonder among his fans. Since his debut album There&#39;s Nothing Like This (1990), he&#39;s dabbled in ragga, hip-hop, funk, jazz-pop, rock, and Caribbean dance sounds. He&#39;s joined by Nakhane, a London-based Xhosa polymath who has published a novel (Piggy Boy Blues) and acted in a feature film (Inxeba, or \"The Wound\") in addition to his musical output. But it&rsquo;s his music that soars highest, with an unmistakable voice that floats over experimental electro pop compositions with lyrics that&mdash;like much of his other work&mdash;tackle the subject of queer identity in conservative society, like his recent duet with ANOHNI, \"New Brighton.\"<\/p>\n\n<div> <\/div><\/p><p>Start time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 9:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: Marcus Garvey Park<\/p>","parkids":"M058","parknames":"Marcus Garvey Park","start":"2019-08-14 19:00:00","end":"2019-08-14 21:00:00","location":"Marcus Garvey Park","categories":"Concerts | Free Summer Concerts","coordinates":"40.80450057983400000, -73.94370269775400000","image":"","pubDate":"Thu, 01 Aug 2019 00:00:19 EDT","pretty_time":"Aug 14 07:00 PM"},{"title":"Movies Under the Stars: The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/08/14/movies-under-the-stars-the-lego-movie-2-the-second-part","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/08/14/movies-under-the-stars-the-lego-movie-2-the-second-part","description":"<p>Date: August 14, 2019<\/p><p><p>Join NYC Parks and the New York City Mayor&#39;s Office of Media and Entertainment for a free film!<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part<\/strong><br />\nIt&#39;s been five years since everything was awesome and the citizens are facing a huge new threat: Lego Duplo invaders from outer space, wrecking everything faster than they can rebuild.

Typical chores such as churning butter, cooking, gathering wood, and hauling water are all part of the full History Camp experience. Children will also travel in time back to the early years of the Revolutionary War and experience the life of a soldier in General George Washington&rsquo;s army. They will lend a hand with pitching tents and setting up camp. &ldquo;Enlistment&rdquo; in the army, military drill, and reconnaissance are also part of the action.<\/p>\n\n<p>The camp is lead by Van Cortlandt House Museum&rsquo;s professional staff, talented living history volunteers, and college students studying material culture and history. Daily activities for  Adventures in Time Summer History Camp are designed in keeping with New York State 4th grade curriculum standards and are appropriate for children ages 6 - 12.  Campers bring their own lunches but Van Cortlandt House Museum provides daily snacks and drinking water.   Adventures in Time is a technology-free experience. Campers may bring a cell phone with them to camp but all phones will be left with the administrative staff in the Welcome Center/Office during camp hours. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Registration<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>We encourage early enrollment, as camp space is limited and enrolls on a first-come, first-served basis.

Movement directions embedded within the piece physically foreground specific singers at different points in the piece, and the singers may move closer to members of the audience, bringing depth to the listener&rsquo;s experience by challenging barriers and introducing a heightened sense of engagement with the performance.<\/p>\n\n<p>Dronechoir combines unfamiliar collaborators with an unrehearsed performance, and everyone is singing together for the first time with people they may never have met before. Throughout the piece, the vocalists learn what their role is within the choir and composition. By committing to this unrehearsed performance the vocalists naturally demonstrate a sense of hope and support, acceptance, love and respect to the audience and each other.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wavehill.org/events/sonic-experience-dronechoir/\"><strong>Register online<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Check <a href=\"https://www.wavehill.org/visit/\">Wave Hill&#39;s Visit page<\/a> for shuttle service.
