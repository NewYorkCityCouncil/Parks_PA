Her affectively charged choreographies move across the fields of dance, theater, and visual art.<\/p>\n\n<p>Troubling the stage and the body as sites of stable representation, Lewis unsettles their edges by inviting frictions and ruptures into her creative process. The resulting experientially-rich works employ interdependence, disorder, and play. Lewis&rsquo;s recent performance trilogy includes Water Will (in Melody) (2018), a gothic tale set in black and white; minor matter (2016), a poetic work illuminated by red; and Sorrow Swag (2014), presented in a saturated blue.<\/p>\n\n<p>For the High Line, Lewis expands her solo work Sensation 1 into an hour-long performance for six dancers. The figure of a vocalist who holds her concluding note forms the basis for Sensation 1/This Interior. Lewis stretches this climatic moment into a sustained articulation of feeling and affect across multiple bodies. An ecstatic choreographed form emerges, dissolving the singular gesture of the iconic pop diva into a collective experience.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 8:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 206-9922<\/p><p>Location: On the High Line at 14th Street (in The High Line)<\/p>","parkids":"M360","parknames":"The High Line","start":"2019-07-23 19:00:00","end":"2019-07-23 20:00:00","contact_phone":"(212) 206-9922","location":"On the High Line at 14th Street (in The High Line)","categories":"Dance","coordinates":"40.74166061574600000, -74.00767326355000000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5d0a7d852fd4a.jpg","pubDate":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 00:00:39 EDT","pretty_time":"Jul 23 07:00 PM"},{"title":"Bryant Park Poetry: Whiting Foundation","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/23/bryant-park-poetry-whiting-foundation","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/23/bryant-park-poetry-whiting-foundation","description":"<p>Date: July 23, 2019<\/p><p><p>Join us for Bryant Park Reading Room&#39;s Poetry series.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sit under the park&#39;s London plane trees and enjoy award-winning poetry by established and emerging poets throughout the summer.

This is a wonderful and wonderfully poignant film for children, camel lovers, and anyone who likes a happy ending.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0373861/videoplayer/vi1319437593?ref_=tt_ov_vi\">Watch the movie trailer<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>7:00 p.m.: Cultural performances and food offerings<br />\nNightfall: Film begins<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Please note:<\/strong> Verify event details and learn more at <a href=\"http://socratessculpturepark.org/programs/films/\">socratessculpturepark.org/films<\/a>.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 10:30 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (718) 956-1819<\/p><p>Location: Socrates Sculpture Park<\/p>","parkids":"Q465","parknames":"Socrates Sculpture Park","start":"2019-07-24 19:00:00","end":"2019-07-24 22:30:00","contact_phone":"(718) 956-1819","location":"Socrates Sculpture Park","categories":"Accessible | Film | Best for Kids | Free Summer Movies | Waterfront","coordinates":"40.76839087611100000, -73.93660759925800000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5cb4ef1507bb6.jpg","pubDate":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 00:00:39 EDT","pretty_time":"Jul 24 07:00 PM"},{"title":"Writers Workshop","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/24/writers-workshop","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/24/writers-workshop","description":"<p>Date: July 24, 2019<\/p><p><p>Bryant Park&#39;s Writers Workshops are geared to sharpen, polish, and improve your skills as a writer. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>Photo Credit: Angelito Jusay.<\/em><\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 8:30 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: Reading Room (in Bryant Park)<\/p>","parkids":"M008","parknames":"Bryant Park","start":"2019-07-24 19:00:00","end":"2019-07-24 20:30:00","location":"Reading Room (in Bryant Park)","categories":"Education | Workshops","coordinates":"40.75411674857600000, -73.98336881399200000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5cc0d07095ba8.jpg","pubDate":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 00:00:39 EDT","pretty_time":"Jul 24 07:00 PM"},{"title":"Non-Fiction Authors","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/24/nonfiction-authors","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/24/nonfiction-authors","description":"<p>Date: July 24, 2019<\/p><p><p>American history as seen through the eyes of preeminent authors.<\/p>\n\n<p>Produced in partnership with the New-York Historical Society.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Photo Credit: Angelito Jusay<\/em><\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 8:30 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: Reading Room (in Bryant Park)<\/p>","parkids":"M008","parknames":"Bryant Park","start":"2019-07-24 19:00:00","end":"2019-07-24 20:30:00","location":"Reading Room (in Bryant Park)","categories":"Talks","coordinates":"40.75411674857600000, -73.98336881399200000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5cc0d10e22857.jpg","pubDate":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 00:00:39 EDT","pretty_time":"Jul 24 07:00 PM"},{"title":"Ocean Breeze Twilight Runs: Neon Dress Theme Night","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/24/2019-ocean-breeze-twilight-runs","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/24/2019-ocean-breeze-twilight-runs","description":"<p>Date: July 24, 2019<\/p><p><p>Join us every Wednesday throughout the summer, from July 10 through August 28, for <a href=\"/events/keyword%20twilight%20runs\">themed Twilight Runs!<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>This free event features a two-mile, fast and flat course on the scenic Midland Beach Promenade.

Her affectively charged choreographies move across the fields of dance, theater, and visual art.<\/p>\n\n<p>Troubling the stage and the body as sites of stable representation, Lewis unsettles their edges by inviting frictions and ruptures into her creative process. The resulting experientially-rich works employ interdependence, disorder, and play. Lewis&rsquo;s recent performance trilogy includes Water Will (in Melody) (2018), a gothic tale set in black and white; minor matter (2016), a poetic work illuminated by red; and Sorrow Swag (2014), presented in a saturated blue.<\/p>\n\n<p>For the High Line, Lewis expands her solo work Sensation 1 into an hour-long performance for six dancers. The figure of a vocalist who holds her concluding note forms the basis for Sensation 1/This Interior. Lewis stretches this climatic moment into a sustained articulation of feeling and affect across multiple bodies. An ecstatic choreographed form emerges, dissolving the singular gesture of the iconic pop diva into a collective experience.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 8:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 206-9922<\/p><p>Location: On the High Line at 14th Street (in The High Line)<\/p>","parkids":"M360","parknames":"The High Line","start":"2019-07-24 19:00:00","end":"2019-07-24 20:00:00","contact_phone":"(212) 206-9922","location":"On the High Line at 14th Street (in The High Line)","categories":"Dance","coordinates":"40.74166061574600000, -74.00767326355000000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5d0a7d852fd4a.jpg","pubDate":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 00:00:39 EDT","pretty_time":"Jul 24 07:00 PM"},{"title":"Bryant Park Non-Fiction Authors: 'How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them'","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/24/bryant-park-nonfiction-authors-how-fascism-works-the-politics-of-us-and-them","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/24/bryant-park-nonfiction-authors-how-fascism-works-the-politics-of-us-and-them","description":"<p>Date: July 24, 2019<\/p><p><p>American history as seen through the eyes of preeminent authors.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Jason Stanley <\/strong>discusses his new book <em><strong>How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>This event is free and open to the public.

Her affectively charged choreographies move across the fields of dance, theater, and visual art.<\/p>\n\n<p>Troubling the stage and the body as sites of stable representation, Lewis unsettles their edges by inviting frictions and ruptures into her creative process. The resulting experientially-rich works employ interdependence, disorder, and play. Lewis&rsquo;s recent performance trilogy includes Water Will (in Melody) (2018), a gothic tale set in black and white; minor matter (2016), a poetic work illuminated by red; and Sorrow Swag (2014), presented in a saturated blue.<\/p>\n\n<p>For the High Line, Lewis expands her solo work Sensation 1 into an hour-long performance for six dancers. The figure of a vocalist who holds her concluding note forms the basis for Sensation 1/This Interior. Lewis stretches this climatic moment into a sustained articulation of feeling and affect across multiple bodies. An ecstatic choreographed form emerges, dissolving the singular gesture of the iconic pop diva into a collective experience.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 8:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 206-9922<\/p><p>Location: On the High Line at 14th Street (in The High Line)<\/p>","parkids":"M360","parknames":"The High Line","start":"2019-07-25 19:00:00","end":"2019-07-25 20:00:00","contact_phone":"(212) 206-9922","location":"On the High Line at 14th Street (in The High Line)","categories":"Dance","coordinates":"40.74166061574600000, -74.00767326355000000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5d0a7d852fd4a.jpg","pubDate":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 00:00:39 EDT","pretty_time":"Jul 25 07:00 PM"},{"title":"Bryant Park Writers Workshop: Fiction Writing","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/25/bryant-park-writers-workshop-fiction-writing","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/25/bryant-park-writers-workshop-fiction-writing","description":"<p>Date: July 25, 2019<\/p><p><p>Workshops geared to sharpen, polish, and improve your skills as a writer.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Fiction Writing<\/strong> with <strong>Shamar Hill<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Produced in partnership with <strong>Gotham Writers Workshop<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>This event is free and open to the public.

At the boathouse we build, maintain, and row a fleet of traditional wooden rowboats. Our rowing program on the Hudson uses Whitehall Gigs, 25 foot long boats for four rowers which can handle the conditions and traffic of the harbor. We have programs using the smaller boats in Prospect Park in Brooklyn and Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. The boats are traditional handmade wooden rowboats of a variety of designs. Some of them were built at Pier 40 as part of our Community Boatbuilding program.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 4:30 pm<\/p><p>End time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: South end of lake (in Van Cortlandt Park)<\/p>","parkids":"X092","parknames":"Van Cortlandt Park","start":"2019-07-26 16:30:00","end":"2019-07-26 19:00:00","location":"South end of lake (in Van Cortlandt Park)","categories":"Nature | Kayaking and Canoeing","coordinates":"40.88915215898600000, -73.89286369085300000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5cfbcfad32cca.JPG","pubDate":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 00:00:39 EDT","pretty_time":"Jul 26 04:30 PM"},{"title":"Carnegie Hall Citywide: Cha Wa","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/26/carnegie-hall-citywide","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/26/carnegie-hall-citywide","description":"<p>Date: July 26, 2019<\/p><p><p>Carnegie Hall Citywide brings Cha Wa&rsquo;s high voltage music, which fuses fat funky beats with New Orleans-style brass and Mardi Gras Indian spectacle, to the park.

Some of the communities you will see are a low lying salt marsh habitat dominated by a monoculture of cordgrass (spartina alterniflora), and a maritime grassland community teeming with biodiversity.<\/p>\n\n<p>Tours will last approximately 30 minutes. <\/p>\n\n<p>Funding for these tours was provided by the Jamaica Bay Rockaway Parks Conservancy.  <\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 1:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 2:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (718) 392-5232<\/p><p>Location: Ecology Park<\/p>","parkids":"","parknames":"","start":"2019-07-27 13:00:00","end":"2019-07-27 14:00:00","contact_phone":"(718) 392-5232","location":"Ecology Park","categories":"Nature | Tours","coordinates":"40.62508164341800000, -73.90646649259000000","image":"","pubDate":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 00:00:39 EDT","pretty_time":"Jul 27 01:00 PM"},{"title":"Art on the Farm","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/27/art-on-the-farm1","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/27/art-on-the-farm1","description":"<p>Date: July 27, 2019<\/p><p><p>Join us for unique family art projects inspired by the farm. <\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 2:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 4:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 830-7722<\/p><p>Location: Urban Farm (in Randall's Island Park)<\/p>","parkids":"M104","parknames":"Randall's Island Park","start":"2019-07-27 14:00:00","end":"2019-07-27 16:00:00","contact_phone":"(212) 830-7722","location":"Urban Farm (in Randall's Island Park)","categories":"Arts & Crafts | Best for Kids | Waterfront","coordinates":"40.78369903564453000, -73.92621612548828000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5cacd2ac21993.jpg","pubDate":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 00:00:39 EDT","pretty_time":"Jul 27 02:00 PM"},{"title":"Arts, Culture & Fun: Queensboro Dance Festival","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/27/arts-culture-fun-queensboro-dance-festival1","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/27/arts-culture-fun-queensboro-dance-festival1","description":"<p>Date: July 27, 2019<\/p><p><p>The annual Queensboro Dance Festival is back at parks all summer long, presenting free performances and dance activities by Queens-based dance companies! <\/p>\n\n<p>Experience a slice of diverse dances including Indian, Flamenco, hip-hop, Greek, contemporary, tap, Filipino, Ecuadorian, African, and more. <\/p>\n\n<p>The 2019 Queensboro Dance Festival tours throughout Queens parks, theaters, plazas, and libraries, featuring 33 dance companies all from Queens.

Through an instructor-led participatory session for all ages, we will engage in a dance/aerobic exercise with a focus on breathing.<\/p>\n\n<p>*Please bring a mat or towel to participate. <br />\n<br />\nLed by Marina Garde.<br />\nGarde received her yoga certification in 2012.  Until her mid-twenties, she experimented with dance and movement, searched through travel, and immersed herself in philosophy. All her classes are infused with the wish that every person connects to their inner self and finds the space to live fully.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About POOLTIME<\/strong><br />\nPOOLTIME is a site-specific public art pavilion by artists Cheryl Wing-Zi Wong and Dev Harlan. It is also a series of community programming that pays homage to the historic Aquacade aquatic amphitheater and centers around the rich history of the Park as a site for the 1939 and 1964 World&rsquo;s Fairs. Now demolished and largely forgotten, the project highlights the Aquacade&#39;s history as a vibrant site for working-class families to convene and aims to discuss the World&rsquo;s Fair structures and their architectural lives and meaning post-exhibition.<\/p>\n\n<p>As a dynamic sculpture, POOLTIME activates an underused public space and also acts as a sundial, whose shadows track the hours of a day, while the pavers tell a story about the landscape transformations over the decades. As a new community hub, POOLTIME will host public programming to explore this history through discussion and movement workshops.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>This project is made possible with funds from the Decentralization Program, a regrant program of the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York State Legislature and administered by the Queens Council on the Arts.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><em>With support from the Parks Build Healthy Communities Grant, led by Partnerships for Parks and made possible by Building Healthy Communities, an initiative of the Mayor&rsquo;s Office and the Fund for Public Health NYC. <\/em><\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 4:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 6:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: Ederle Terrace Lawn<\/p>","parkids":"","parknames":"","start":"2019-07-28 16:00:00","end":"2019-07-28 18:00:00","location":"Ederle Terrace Lawn","categories":"Accessible | Education | Dance | Art | History | Talks","coordinates":"40.73923789246900000, -73.84138107299800000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5d237f004215c.jpeg","pubDate":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 00:00:39 EDT","pretty_time":"Jul 28 04:00 PM"},{"title":"Plein Aire Arte, Waterfront Inkscapes, and Fresh Perspective Interviews","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/28/pein-aire-arte-waterfront-inkscapes-and-fresh-perspective-interviews","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/28/pein-aire-arte-waterfront-inkscapes-and-fresh-perspective-interviews","description":"<p>Date: July 28, 2019<\/p><p><p>&ldquo;Walk This Way: Imagining My Staten Island&rdquo; is a series of creative workshops to celebrate the diversity of Staten Island residents in relation to the waterfront and the link between its unique people, and their distinct and diverse neighborhoods.<\/p>\n\n<p>Join <a href=\"http://www.labyrinthartscollective.org\">Labyrinth Arts Collective<\/a> for their Pein Aire Arte, Waterfront Inkscapes, and Fresh Perspective Interviews.<\/p>\n\n<p>This project is part of ArtBuilt Mobile Studio in the Park, a partnership with ArtBuilt, NYC Parks, and the Queens Museum.

Additional support is provided by the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs and the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York State Legislature.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 9:00 am<\/p><p>End time: 5:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 360-8163<\/p><p>Location: Arsenal (in Central Park)<\/p>","parkids":"M010","parknames":"Central Park","start":"2019-08-01 09:00:00","end":"2019-08-01 17:00:00","contact_phone":"(212) 360-8163","location":"Arsenal (in Central Park)","categories":"Accessible | Art | History | Seniors","coordinates":"40.76720046997100000, -73.97129821777300000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5cf68d2f78c67.jpeg","pubDate":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 00:00:39 EDT","pretty_time":"Aug 01 09:00 AM"},{"title":"Kids Summer Morning Recreation","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/08/01/kids-summer-morning-recreation1","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/08/01/kids-summer-morning-recreation1","description":"<p>Date: August 1, 2019<\/p><p><p>Kids will engage in fun tabletop games and physical activities.

The Stylistics had a stunning run of top ten R&B singles out of Philadelphia in the early 70s, with some, such as \"Break Up to Make Up\" and \"You Make Me Feel Brand New,\" cracking the top ten on the pop charts. The Manhattans (who hailed from Jersey City, NJ) formed in the 60s as a doo-wop group but were able to sustain success into the early 80s, winning a Grammy in 1981 for their R&B hit \"Shining Star.\" Harold Melvin&#39;s Blue Notes got their start as The Charlemagnes in the 1950s, but didn&#39;t break out until the early 70s, when they brought in a young Teddy Pendergrass (first as a drummer, then as lead singer) and signed to Gamble & Huff&#39;s Philadelphia International label. Their biggest hits include \"If You Don&#39;t Know Me by Now,\" \"I Miss You,\" and \"Wake Up Everybody\"; in 1976 Thelma Houston would score a #1 hit on the pop charts with a cover of their song \"Don&#39;t Leave Me This Way,\" which would come to be known as one of the disco era&#39;s most iconic hits.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 6:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 10:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: Ford Amphitheater at Coney Island<\/p>","parkids":"","parknames":"","start":"2019-08-03 18:00:00","end":"2019-08-03 22:00:00","location":"Ford Amphitheater at Coney Island","categories":"Concerts | Free Summer Concerts","coordinates":"40.57276875888900000, -73.98810589947500000","image":"","pubDate":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 00:00:39 EDT","pretty_time":"Aug 03 06:00 PM"},{"title":"Family Camping: Bronx","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/08/03/family-camping-bronx","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/08/03/family-camping-bronx","description":"<p>Date: August 3, 2019<\/p><p><p>Camp overnight in NYC&#39;s largest park with the Urban Park Rangers!<\/p>\n\n<p>We camp to create lasting memories, connect with the natural world, and bond with our families.

Prospect Park Alliance and Turnstile Tours host a series of themed walking tours that examine the many layers of natural and human history to be found in Brooklyn&#39;s Backyard. Tours begin at the Brooklyn Public Library at Grand Army Plaza.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Hidden Treasures Tour (1st Sundays):<\/strong> Explore some of the little-known corners of Prospect Park in this tour that uncovers some of the park&rsquo;s hidden treasures. Once prime attractions, these areas are currently the focus of Prospect Park Alliance restoration efforts to revitalize the park. The tour includes the Rose Garden and Vale of Cashmere in the park&rsquo;s northeast corner, and well as a guided walk through Brooklyn&rsquo;s last remaining forest, the 150-acre Ravine.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Waterways & Wellhouse Tour (2nd Sundays): <\/strong>Prospect Park is an engineering marvel, designed around an ingenious drainage system and a chain of manmade streams and ponds that terminate in Brooklyn&rsquo;s largest lake. This tour will follow the park&rsquo;s scenic watercourse and delve into how Prospect Park Alliance maintains and supports this complex system. The tour will end with a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most unique features of the park: the 1869 Wellhouse, the park&rsquo;s last remaining building by park designer Calvert Vaux, which once housed the machinery that fueled the  watercourse and was recently restored by the Alliance and converted into the first composting restrooms in a NYC park.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Art & Architecture Tour (3rd Sundays): <\/strong>For over 150 years, Prospect Park has been a showcase for beautiful public buildings and artwork, with representations from eras including Beaux-Arts, City Beautiful, the New Deal Modernism, and contemporary LEED-certified projects. This tour will examine some of the fine architectural details and ongoing restoration work, from the era of Vaux and Olmsted to the present day.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Brooklyn&rsquo;s Backyard Tour &ndash; includes Zoo and Carousel admission (4th Sundays): <\/strong>Prospect Park is an oasis for people &ndash; and animals! Discover the native habitats and inhabitants of the park, and explore the past and present of recreation, animals, and ongoing conservation efforts of the Prospect Park Alliance. This tour includes an interactive scavenger for children and adults, and ends at the park&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Corner, with a special visit to Prospect Park Zoo and tickets to ride the historic Carousel.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.prospectpark.org/visit-the-park/things-to-do/tours/\">Learn more and get tickets today<\/a>!<\/strong><\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 10:30 am<\/p><p>End time: 12:30 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: Prospect Park<\/p>","parkids":"B073","parknames":"Prospect Park","start":"2019-08-04 10:30:00","end":"2019-08-04 12:30:00","location":"Prospect Park","categories":"Art | History | Tours","coordinates":"40.66170120239258000, -73.97080230712890000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5c9a84bce58c9.JPG","pubDate":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 00:00:39 EDT","pretty_time":"Aug 04 10:30 AM"},{"title":"The Old Stone House: Witness to War","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/08/04/the-old-stone-house-witness-to-war","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/08/04/the-old-stone-house-witness-to-war","description":"<p>Date: August 4, 2019<\/p><p><p>A permanent <a href=\"http://theoldstonehouse.org/exhibitions/\">exhibit<\/a> exploring the Battle of Brooklyn and the Occupation, 1776-1783<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Old Stone House: Witness to War<\/em> is a self-directed exhibit that takes visitors on a journey through the Revolutionary Era in Brooklyn from 1776 until 1783.
