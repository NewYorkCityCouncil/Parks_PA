Each has explored narratives about contested space that draw on personal and cultural touch points, reflecting a synergy to their work and shared interests that will be reinforced by their projects this spring.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hoffman&rsquo;s mixed-media paintings and installations take inspiration from the Philippine weaving and the Jewish folk traditions of her ancestors, layered geographies emerging from materials collected from her everyday life. Based in Brooklyn, Hupfield is a citizen of the Anishinaabek Nation from Wasauksing First Nation in Ontario, Canada. Her sculptural body-objects, crafted from industrial felt, are often activated through performance. Also based in Brooklyn, Filipina-Canadian artist Jimenez&rsquo;s installations and performances draw from familial narratives, abandoned objects and colonial texts, as well as photos, maps, and textiles, to focus on concepts of origin and home, loss, and absence. In the Sunroom Project Space, Rachel Sydlowski&rsquo;s installation consists of layers of historical wallpaper that serve as a background for complex screen-print collages of flora and fauna, architectural details and decorative motifs from Wave Hill, Inwood Hill Park, and other surrounding green spaces, transforming the Sunroom into an anachronistic collage of past and present.<\/p>\n\n<p>Pictured: Sara Jimenez, Binding Time, 2015, Floral compost and fabric, 15 x 11 x 8 feet, Image by Daniel Kukla<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 2:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 4:30 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (718) 549-3200<\/p><p>Location: Glyndor Gallery (in Wave Hill)<\/p>","parkids":"X209","parknames":"Wave Hill","start":"2019-04-14 14:00:00","end":"2019-04-14 16:30:00","contact_phone":"(718) 549-3200","location":"Glyndor Gallery (in Wave Hill)","categories":"Art","coordinates":"40.89886474609375000, -73.91186523437500000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5c61a3158a6d5.jpg","pubDate":"Thu, 11 Apr 2019 23:59:45 EDT","pretty_time":"Apr 14 02:00 PM"},{"title":"Central Park Tour: Seneca Village","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/04/14/central-park-tour-seneca-village","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/04/14/central-park-tour-seneca-village","description":"<p>Date: April 14, 2019<\/p><p><p>Seneca Village was an important community of predominantly African-American property owners, living in an area that now makes up part of Central Park.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Join Central Park Conservancy guides on this tour to learn about the lives of Seneca Village&rsquo;s residents in the 1800s and the community&rsquo;s place in pre-Central Park.

Papp&rsquo;s original touring company evolved into the New York Shakespeare Festival, and ultimately became The Public Theater. All of it was built on a simple idea: Culture belongs to everyone. This idea remains at the heart of The Public Theater&rsquo;s work to this day. And our Mobile Unit still takes this mission out to the communities across New York City, providing free performances to all. The Mobile Unit presents free Shakespeare to prisons, homeless shelters, and community centers throughout New York&rsquo;s boroughs. Over the years, the Mobile Unit has served thousands of audiences with critically acclaimed productions. In addition to the community tour, each Mobile Unit show &ldquo;sits down&rdquo; at The Public Theater&rsquo;s Astor Place home to perform for Public audiences and community organizations from all over the city.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 1:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 2:30 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (718) 816-8686<\/p><p>Location: Roy Wilkins Recreation Center<\/p>","parkids":"Q448","parknames":"Roy Wilkins Recreation Center","start":"2019-04-15 13:00:00","end":"2019-04-15 14:30:00","contact_phone":"(718) 816-8686","location":"Roy Wilkins Recreation Center","categories":"Accessible | Theater | Seniors","coordinates":"40.68807220458984400, -73.77011108398438000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5c794a232560d.JPG","pubDate":"Thu, 11 Apr 2019 23:59:45 EDT","pretty_time":"Apr 15 01:00 PM"},{"title":"Central Park Tour: Stroll to Strawberry Fields","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/04/15/central-park-tour-stroll-to-strawberry-fields","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/04/15/central-park-tour-stroll-to-strawberry-fields","description":"<p>Date: April 15, 2019<\/p><p><p>Explore the southwest of Central Park with Central Park Conservancy tour guides, and see it like never before.

Each has explored narratives about contested space that draw on personal and cultural touch points, reflecting a synergy to their work and shared interests that will be reinforced by their projects this spring.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hoffman&rsquo;s mixed-media paintings and installations take inspiration from the Philippine weaving and the Jewish folk traditions of her ancestors, layered geographies emerging from materials collected from her everyday life. Based in Brooklyn, Hupfield is a citizen of the Anishinaabek Nation from Wasauksing First Nation in Ontario, Canada. Her sculptural body-objects, crafted from industrial felt, are often activated through performance. Also based in Brooklyn, Filipina-Canadian artist Jimenez&rsquo;s installations and performances draw from familial narratives, abandoned objects and colonial texts, as well as photos, maps and textiles, to focus on concepts of origin and home, loss and absence. In the Sunroom Project Space, Rachel Sydlowski&rsquo;s installation consists of layers of historical wallpaper that serve as a background for complex, screen-print collages of flora and fauna, architectural details and decorative motifs from Wave Hill, Inwood Hill Park and other surrounding green spaces, transforming the Sunroom into an anachronistic collage of past and present.

Each presentation is preceded by an extended conversation between the artist and curator.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About the Artist<\/strong><br />\nNate Wooley was born in 1974 in Clatskanie, Oregon, a town of 2,000 people in the timber country of the Pacific Northwestern corner of the U.S. He began playing trumpet professionally with his father, a big band saxophonist, at the age of 13. His time in Oregon, a place of relative quiet and slow time reference, instilled in Nate a musical aesthetic that has informed all of his music making for the past 20 years, but in no situation more than his solo trumpet performances.<\/p>\n\n<p>After moving from Oregon to New York in 2001, Nate Wooley has become one of the most in-demand trumpet players in the burgeoning Brooklyn jazz, improv, noise, and new music scenes. He has performed regularly with such icons as John Zorn, Anthony Braxton, Eliane Radigue, Ken Vandermark, Fred Frith, Evan Parker, and Yoshi Wada, as well as being a collaborator with some of the brightest lights of his generation like Chris Corsano, C. Spencer Yeh, Peter Evans, and Mary Halvorson. Wooley has been gathering international acclaim for his idiosyncratic trumpet language. Time Out New York has called him &ldquo;an iconoclastic trumpeter&rdquo;, and Downbeat&rsquo;s Jazz Musician of the Year, Dave Douglas has said, &ldquo;Nate Wooley is one of the most interesting and unusual trumpet players living today, and that is without hyperbole&rdquo;. In 2011 he was an artist in residence at Issue Project Room in Brooklyn, NY and Cafe Oto in London, England. In 2013 he performed at the Walker Art Center as a featured solo artist.<\/p>\n\n<p>Nate is the curator of the Database of Recorded American Music and the editor-in-chief of their online quarterly journal Sound American both of which are dedicated to broadening the definition of American music through their online presence and the physical distribution of music through Sound American Records. He also runs Pleasure of the Text which releases music by composers of experimental music at the beginnings of their careers in rough and ready mediums.<\/p>\n\n<p>Wooley was a 2016 recipient of the Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award and a 2017 recipient of funding from the Mid-Atlantic Arts Foundation for his work with Seven Storey Mountain.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 8:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 10:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: Old Stone House (in J.J.

How can we connect with nature in a society that continues to give primacy to disposability and mass-consumption? How do we move away from a mindset of scarcity to one of collaboration? How can we be transformed from the egocentric &ldquo;i&rdquo; to the love supreme &ldquo;I AM&rdquo;?  In this work, artist Tattfoo Tan uses participatory prompts, games, and affirmations to engage you in the play of the universe. Let the process begin.<\/p>\n\n<p>Staten Island-based artist Tattfoo Tan&rsquo;s practice focuses on issues relating to ecology, sustainability, and healthy living. His work is project-based, ephemeral and educational in nature. Tan has exhibited at venues including the Queens Museum of Art, Eugene Lang College at the New School for Liberal Arts, Parsons the New School for Design, the Fashion Institute of Technology, Wave Hill, Macalester College, Ballroom Marfa, Creative Time, Project Row Houses, and the Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati. Tan&rsquo;s projects have been presented by the Laundromat Project, the City of New York Department of Cultural Affairs Percent for the Arts program, and the City of Philadelphia Mural Arts program. His work has been published by Gestalten and Thames and Hudson.<\/p>\n\n<p>Tan has been widely recognized for his artistic contributions and service to the community, and is the proud recipient of a proclamation from The City of New York. He is the recipient of grants from Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, Art Matters, Joan Mitchell Foundation, the Pulitzer Arts Foundation, and Staten Island Arts.  In 2010, Tan received the annual Award for Excellence in Design by the Public Design Commission of the City of New York for his design and branding of the Super-Graphic on Bronx River Art Center. He currently serves on the Mayor&rsquo;s Citizens&rsquo; Advisory Committee to support the development of a Comprehensive Cultural Plan.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>All exhibits and programs are located in the Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art (Buildings C & G).

Parks are becoming a logical alternative environment for those who want to add variety to their work outs, or who just don&#39;t like the gym. And, it&#39;s an affordable way to increase physical activity opportunities, because there&#39;s nothing special to build.<\/p>\n\n<p>Come to Fort Tryon Park and try something new. Join us on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday mornings for one hour of walking, stretching, and strengthening exercises.<\/p>\n\n<p>All of our fitness programs are free, led by trained professionals, and suitable for all levels. Wear comfortable clothing and bring water. <\/p>\n\n<p>Exercising with a view, in natural sunlight, with green scenery all around bestow health benefits that can&rsquo;t be found indoors.

Papp&rsquo;s original touring company evolved into the New York Shakespeare Festival, and ultimately became The Public Theater. All of it was built on a simple idea: Culture belongs to everyone. This idea remains at the heart of The Public Theater&rsquo;s work to this day. And our Mobile Unit still takes this mission out to the communities across New York City, providing free performances to all. The Mobile Unit presents free Shakespeare to prisons, homeless shelters, and community centers throughout New York&rsquo;s boroughs. Over the years, the Mobile Unit has served thousands of audiences with critically acclaimed productions. In addition to the community tour, each Mobile Unit show &ldquo;sits down&rdquo; at The Public Theater&rsquo;s Astor Place home to perform for Public audiences and community organizations from all over the city.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 12:30 pm<\/p><p>End time: 2:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (718) 816-5558<\/p><p>Location: Faber Park Field House (in Faber Pool and Park)<\/p>","parkids":"R008","parknames":"Faber Pool and Park","start":"2019-04-20 12:30:00","end":"2019-04-20 14:00:00","contact_phone":"(718) 816-5558","location":"Faber Park Field House (in Faber Pool and Park)","categories":"Accessible | Theater | Seniors","coordinates":"40.64100930966100000, -74.13538718223600000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5c794a10c4aa3.JPG","pubDate":"Thu, 11 Apr 2019 23:59:45 EDT","pretty_time":"Apr 20 12:30 PM"},{"title":"Threads: Flax to Linen, Field to Fabric","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/04/20/threads-flax-to-linen-field-to-fabric2","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/04/20/threads-flax-to-linen-field-to-fabric2","description":"<p>Date: April 20, 2019<\/p><p><p>\"Threads\" examines the history of linen production from field to fabric.

Each has explored narratives about contested space that draw on personal and cultural touch points, reflecting a synergy to their work and shared interests that will be reinforced by their projects this spring.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hoffman&rsquo;s mixed-media paintings and installations take inspiration from the Philippine weaving and the Jewish folk traditions of her ancestors, layered geographies emerging from materials collected from her everyday life. Based in Brooklyn, Hupfield is a citizen of the Anishinaabek Nation from Wasauksing First Nation in Ontario, Canada. Her sculptural body-objects, crafted from industrial felt, are often activated through performance. Also based in Brooklyn, Filipina-Canadian artist Jimenez&rsquo;s installations and performances draw from familial narratives, abandoned objects and colonial texts, as well as photos, maps, and textiles, to focus on concepts of origin and home, loss and absence. In the Sunroom Project Space, Rachel Sydlowski&rsquo;s installation consists of layers of historical wallpaper that serve as a background for complex, screen-print collages of flora and fauna, architectural details and decorative motifs from Wave Hill, Inwood Hill Park and other surrounding green spaces, transforming the Sunroom into an anachronistic collage of past and present.

Each has explored narratives about contested space that draw on personal and cultural touch points, reflecting a synergy to their work and shared interests that will be reinforced by their projects this spring.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hoffman&rsquo;s mixed-media paintings and installations take inspiration from the Philippine weaving and the Jewish folk traditions of her ancestors, layered geographies emerging from materials collected from her everyday life. Based in Brooklyn, Hupfield is a citizen of the Anishinaabek Nation from Wasauksing First Nation in Ontario, Canada. Her sculptural body-objects, crafted from industrial felt, are often activated through performance. Also based in Brooklyn, Filipina-Canadian artist Jimenez&rsquo;s installations and performances draw from familial narratives, abandoned objects and colonial texts, as well as photos, maps and textiles, to focus on concepts of origin and home, loss and absence. In the Sunroom Project Space, Rachel Sydlowski&rsquo;s installation consists of layers of historical wallpaper that serve as a background for complex, screen-print collages of flora and fauna, architectural details and decorative motifs from Wave Hill, Inwood Hill Park and other surrounding green spaces, transforming the Sunroom into an anachronistic collage of past and present.

Papp&rsquo;s original touring company evolved into the New York Shakespeare Festival, and ultimately became The Public Theater. All of it was built on a simple idea: Culture belongs to everyone. This idea remains at the heart of The Public Theater&rsquo;s work to this day. And our Mobile Unit still takes this mission out to the communities across New York City, providing free performances to all. The Mobile Unit presents free Shakespeare to prisons, homeless shelters, and community centers throughout New York&rsquo;s boroughs. Over the years, the Mobile Unit has served thousands of audiences with critically-acclaimed productions. In addition to the community tour, each Mobile Unit show &ldquo;sits down&rdquo; at The Public Theater&rsquo;s Astor Place home to perform for Public audiences and community organizations from all over the city.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 8:30 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (718) 349-0444<\/p><p>Location: ARROW Field House<\/p>","parkids":"","parknames":"","start":"2019-04-23 19:00:00","end":"2019-04-23 20:30:00","contact_phone":"(718) 349-0444","location":"ARROW Field House","categories":"Accessible | Theater | Seniors","coordinates":"40.75576019287109400, -73.92633819580078000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5c79497e349ce.JPG","pubDate":"Thu, 11 Apr 2019 23:59:45 EDT","pretty_time":"Apr 23 07:00 PM"},{"title":"Senior Games Clinics: Basketball","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/04/24/senior-games-clinics-basketball1","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/04/24/senior-games-clinics-basketball1","description":"<p>Date: April 24, 2019<\/p><p><p>Train with us for the <a href=\"/highlights/festivals/senior-games\">NYC Parks Senior Games<\/a>!
