Join us on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday mornings for one hour of walking, stretching, and strengthening exercises.<\/p>\n\n<p>For a breath of fresh air, take your workouts outdoors. Parks are becoming a logical alternative environment for those who want to add variety to their workouts, or who just don&#39;t like the gym. And, it&#39;s an affordable way to increase physical activity opportunities, because there&#39;s nothing special to build.<\/p>\n\n<p>Exercise with a view, in natural sunlight, with green scenery all around bestows health benefits that can&rsquo;t be found indoors. Scientific studies have shown that the pleasure of being outdoors for example gives your brain, psyche, and immune system an extra boost.<\/p>\n\n<p>All of our fitness programs are free, led by trained professionals, and suitable for all levels. Wear comfortable clothing and bring water. Please check back for rain and weather/air advisory cancels.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Please note: <\/strong>Fitness programs are canceled if the weather is lower than 20 degrees and when there are icy conditions.

Using reclaimed wood as a basis, she appropriates the history of salvaged materials to create structures that evoke the living processes of an organism.

Their wealth and influence left behind a legacy that is visible in the street names and landmarks of the area. But just who were the Van Cortlandts anyway? Unlike many prominent early Americans, they did not leave behind journals nor much correspondence to shed light on their story. But some maps and documents do exist&mdash;scattered in various archives and libraries around New York and beyond. These fragments begin to reveal how the Bronx contingent of this family amassed their wealth, expanded their estate, and navigated the turbulence of the American Revolution. <\/p>\n\n<p>The lecture is free to attend but donations to be shared by the Museum and Historical Society are always welcome.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About Van Cortlandt House Museum<\/strong><br />\nSince 1896, Van Cortlandt House Museum has been under the stewardship of The National Society of Colonial Dames in the State of New York through a license agreement with the City of New York. The Society is responsible for preserving and restoring the interiors, providing and caring for the collections, offering educational opportunities to school children throughout New York City, and assuring that the doors to Van Cortlandt House are open to visitors six days a week all year round. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About the Kingsbridge Historical Society<\/strong><br />\nThe Kingsbridge Historical Society was founded in 1949. It was the first and is the oldest, local historical society in the Bronx. The Society&rsquo;s focus is on the history of the greater Kingsbridge area, located in the north-west Bronx. The society&rsquo;s name is derived from the historic King&rsquo;s Bridge and its environs, which include present-day Riverdale, Kingsbridge, Spuyten Duyvil, Marble Hill, Inwood, Van Cortlandt, and Fieldston. <\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 8:30 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (718) 543-3344<\/p><p>Location: Van Cortlandt House Museum (in Van Cortlandt Park)<\/p>","parkids":"X092","parknames":"Van Cortlandt Park","start":"2019-05-16 19:00:00","end":"2019-05-16 20:30:00","contact_phone":"(718) 543-3344","location":"Van Cortlandt House Museum (in Van Cortlandt Park)","categories":"History | Talks","coordinates":"40.89114379882812500, -73.89489746093750000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5cbde92813b98.jpg","pubDate":"Sun, 12 May 2019 23:58:33 EDT","pretty_time":"May 16 07:00 PM"},{"title":"Shakespeare - Hamlet: Princess of Denmark","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/05/16/shakespeare-hamlet","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/05/16/shakespeare-hamlet","description":"<p>Date: May 16, 2019<\/p><p><p>Many women have played Hamlet throughout history, but rarely have they played Hamlet as a woman.

How can we connect with nature in a society that continues to give primacy to disposability and mass-consumption? How do we move away from a mindset of scarcity to one of collaboration? How can we be transformed from the egocentric &ldquo;i&rdquo; to the love supreme &ldquo;I AM&rdquo;?  In this work, artist Tattfoo Tan uses participatory prompts, games, and affirmations to engage you in the play of the universe. Let the process begin.<\/p>\n\n<p>Staten Island-based artist Tattfoo Tan&rsquo;s practice focuses on issues relating to ecology, sustainability, and healthy living. His work is project-based, ephemeral and educational in nature.

Prospect Park Alliance and Turnstile Tours host a series of themed walking tours that examine the many layers of natural and human history to be found in Brooklyn&#39;s Backyard. Tours begin at the Brooklyn Public Library at Grand Army Plaza.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Hidden Treasures Tour (1st Sundays):<\/strong> Explore some of the little-known corners of Prospect Park in this tour that uncovers some of the park&rsquo;s hidden treasures. Once prime attractions, these areas are currently the focus of Prospect Park Alliance restoration efforts to revitalize the park. The tour includes the Rose Garden and Vale of Cashmere in the park&rsquo;s northeast corner, and well as a guided walk through Brooklyn&rsquo;s last remaining forest, the 150-acre Ravine.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Waterways & Wellhouse Tour (2nd Sundays): <\/strong>Prospect Park is an engineering marvel, designed around an ingenious drainage system and a chain of manmade streams and ponds that terminate in Brooklyn&rsquo;s largest lake. This tour will follow the park&rsquo;s scenic watercourse and delve into how Prospect Park Alliance maintains and supports this complex system. The tour will end with a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most unique features of the park: the 1869 Wellhouse, the park&rsquo;s last remaining building by park designer Calvert Vaux, which once housed the machinery that fueled the  watercourse and was recently restored by the Alliance and converted into the first composting restrooms in a NYC park.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Art & Architecture Tour (3rd Sundays): <\/strong>For over 150 years, Prospect Park has been a showcase for beautiful public buildings and artwork, with representations from eras including Beaux-Arts, City Beautiful, the New Deal Modernism, and contemporary LEED-certified projects. This tour will examine some of the fine architectural details and ongoing restoration work, from the era of Vaux and Olmsted to the present day.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Brooklyn&rsquo;s Backyard Tour &ndash; includes Zoo and Carousel admission (4th Sundays): <\/strong>Prospect Park is an oasis for people &ndash; and animals! Discover the native habitats and inhabitants of the park, and explore the past and present of recreation, animals, and ongoing conservation efforts of the Prospect Park Alliance.

We&rsquo;ll discuss the ecological and economic problems engendered by the new churches as well as the uncertain status of historic religious institutions.<\/p>\n\n<p>The first stop on our tour will be the Quaker Meeting House (built in 1694). We&rsquo;ll end the tour by 2:30 pm at the St. Michael&rsquo;s Roman Catholic church. <\/p>\n\n<p>We will also pass by a number of remarkable new and older houses of worship from tiny storefront churches to the elaborate Korean Buddhist temple, Masjid Abu Bakr Mosque, Mormon church, Sikh Temple, and Temple (Jewish) Gates of Prayer.<br />\n<br />\nThe tour will be lead by urban geographer Jack Eichenbaum, Ph.D. &ndash; the appointed Queens Borough Historian.

The tour will end with a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most unique features of the park: the 1869 Wellhouse, the park&rsquo;s last remaining building by park designer Calvert Vaux, which once housed the machinery that fueled the  watercourse and was recently restored by the Alliance and converted into the first composting restrooms in a NYC park.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Art & Architecture Tour (3rd Sundays): <\/strong>For over 150 years, Prospect Park has been a showcase for beautiful public buildings and artwork, with representations from eras including Beaux-Arts, City Beautiful, the New Deal Modernism, and contemporary LEED-certified projects.
