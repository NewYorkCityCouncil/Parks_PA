Moviegoers are encouraged to bring their own blankets and picnics for the movie night that&#39;s turned into an annual tradition for the Astoria Park Alliance.<\/p>\n\n<p>Attendees are encouraged to RSVP on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/420480948502238/\">Facebook<\/a>.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 8:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 10:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: 5164550234<\/p><p>Location: Great Lawn (in Astoria Park)<\/p>","parkids":"Q004","parknames":"Astoria Park","start":"2019-06-07 20:00:00","end":"2019-06-07 22:00:00","contact_phone":"5164550234","location":"Great Lawn (in Astoria Park)","categories":"Film | Waterfront | Movies Under the Stars","coordinates":"40.78045660379500000, -73.92074298858600000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5ceacc6c378ad.jpg","pubDate":"Wed, 05 Jun 2019 23:59:58 EDT","pretty_time":"Jun 07 08:00 PM"},{"title":"Movies Under the Stars - Avengers: Infinity War","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/06/07/movies-under-the-stars-avengers-infinity-war","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/06/07/movies-under-the-stars-avengers-infinity-war","description":"<p>Date: June 7, 2019<\/p><p><p>Join NYC Parks and the New York City&#39;s Mayor&#39;s Office of Media and Entertainment for a free film!<\/p>\n\n<p>The Avengers assemble their power in order to fight their collective enemy, Thanos, before he can wreak havoc on the entire planet.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Know Before You Go<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Grab a blanket or towel and come enjoy a movie in the park.

The tour will end with a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most unique features of the park: the 1869 Wellhouse, the park&rsquo;s last remaining building by park designer Calvert Vaux, which once housed the machinery that fueled the  watercourse and was recently restored by the Alliance and converted into the first composting restrooms in a NYC park.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Art & Architecture Tour (3rd Sundays): <\/strong>For over 150 years, Prospect Park has been a showcase for beautiful public buildings and artwork, with representations from eras including Beaux-Arts, City Beautiful, the New Deal Modernism, and contemporary LEED-certified projects.

In conjunction with NYC Parks, the pavilion will be installed at the north end of Meadow Lake in Flushing Meadows Corona Park this summer 2019. POOLTIME is a public pavilion and series of community programming centered around the rich history of the Park as a site for the 1939 and 1964 World&rsquo;s Fairs. POOLTIME activates an underused public space and aims to discuss the World&rsquo;s Fair structures and their architectural lives and meaning post-exhibition.<\/p>\n\n<p>This public art pavilion pays homage to the historic Aquacade aquatic amphitheater constructed for the 1939 World&rsquo;s Fair, whose structures transformed Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. The amphitheater was reused and activated during the 1964 World&rsquo;s Fair held in New York. Now demolished and largely forgotten, the Aquacade aquatic amphitheater was a large community hub and heart of the park even decades after many of the other World&rsquo;s Fair attractions had fallen into decay and disuse.

At the age of 11, Rokafella had thus far found her step and was on the path of becoming a B-Girl. Garcia is not only a renowned dancer but also a poet, musician, filmmaker, and entrepreneur. Rokafella is also regarded as the pioneer for the new generation of B-Girls and B-Boys. Raised in Spanish Harlem by Puerto Rican immigrants, Garcia grew up seeing hip hop performed in her own neighborhood during the late 1970s and &#39;80s. In 1991, veteran breakdancer Kwikstep took Garcia on as a mentee. She would go on to dance with many crews in New York City including The Transformers, The Breeze Team, and the New York City Float Committee. With her now-husband, Kwikstep, Rokafella co-founded and performs with the non-profit hip-hop dance company Full Circle Productions to empower young dancers through the positive power of hip-hop.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>DJ Perly <\/strong>is a female Puerto Rican Russian American DK who plays hip hop, breaks, and house music, and practices the art of turntablism with a passion.

Come visit \"Whispers in the Grove\", an interactive, multimedia art installation at the East River Park Compost Yard which will be on view from June 15 through September.<\/p>\n\n<p>Join us for a day of family-friendly activities that will include viewing soil samples under BioBus microscope, worm bin demonstration, mixing potting soil, and decorating your own planter.<\/p>\n\n<p>Inspired by mycorrhiza, trees&#39; communication through an underground network of roots and mycelium fungus, the artists built steel trees topped by cell-like bulbs made of reclaimed bottle caps from different cities around the USA. The forest-like structure is illuminated with internal lights; voice tubes invite people to whisper to each other from across the sculpture; and for the opening, a soundscape by poet Nicole Celeste Anderson will guide participants in contemplating life in symbiosis. Our budding understanding of the mycorrhiza phenomenon makes humans and plants seem more similar. This network is reminiscent of human neurons, the internet, even our network of roads connecting cities. Through \"Whispers in the Grove,\" artists Kathy Creutzburg, Natalia Lesniak, and Mirabai Kwan Yin seek to pique the public&#39;s interest in science and nature, as well as fostering a sense of interconnection between humans and plants, leading to responsible conservation efforts and sustainable practices.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Whispers in the Grove\" is made possible in part with public funds from Creative Engagement, supported by the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in partnership with the City Council, and administered by LMCC. LMCC empowers artists by providing them with networks, resources, and support to create vibrant, sustainable communities in Manhattan and beyond.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.com/e/whispers-in-the-grove-tickets-60722586892\"><strong>Register for free on <\/strong><\/a><strong><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/whispers-in-the-grove-tickets-60722586892\">Eventbrite<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>For any questions about this event, please contact Peter Tzannes at <a href=\"mailto:peter@lesecologycenter.org\">peter@lesecologycenter.org<\/a> or (212) 477-4022.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 3:30 pm<\/p><p>End time: 8:30 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 477-4022<\/p><p>Location: East River Park Compost Yard (in Corlears Hook Park)<\/p>","parkids":"M017","parknames":"Corlears Hook Park","start":"2019-06-15 15:30:00","end":"2019-06-15 20:30:00","contact_phone":"(212) 477-4022","location":"East River Park Compost Yard (in Corlears Hook Park)","categories":"Arts & Crafts | Education | Nature | Art","coordinates":"40.71124167157800000, -73.97869026660800000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5cd2fdfd5c5fb.jpg","pubDate":"Wed, 05 Jun 2019 23:59:58 EDT","pretty_time":"Jun 15 03:30 PM"},{"title":"Metropolitan Opera Summer Recital","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/06/15/the-metropolitan-opera-summer-recital-series","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/06/15/the-metropolitan-opera-summer-recital-series","description":"<p>Date: June 15, 2019<\/p><p><p>Join us to enjoy a program of favorite opera arias and duets from Metropolitan Opera rising stars Leah Hawkins, Mario Bahg, Dimitri Dover and Joseph Lim.

The tour will end with a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most unique features of the park: the 1869 Wellhouse, the park&rsquo;s last remaining building by park designer Calvert Vaux, which once housed the machinery that fueled the  watercourse and was recently restored by the Alliance and converted into the first composting restrooms in a NYC park.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Art & Architecture Tour (3rd Sundays): <\/strong>For over 150 years, Prospect Park has been a showcase for beautiful public buildings and artwork, with representations from eras including Beaux-Arts, City Beautiful, the New Deal Modernism, and contemporary LEED-certified projects.
