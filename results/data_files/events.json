Boats are available on a first-come-first-served basis, no reservations.<\/p>\n\n<p>Rowing is a beautifully simple, healthy, and empowering sport, and the waters of the lake are an ideal place to pursue its pleasures. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Who can participate:<\/strong><br />\nCommunity rowing is open to all, although some physical agility is required to get in and out of the boats. The focus of the program is recreation in a safe and respectful environment. Each adult must sign a waiver; children must be accompanied by a parent. Life jackets are provided&mdash;and must be worn!<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Volunteers<\/strong> are greatly appreciated! To help with set up, meet at the container in the parking lot south of the lake at 4:00 p.m.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Cost<\/strong><br />\nIt&rsquo;s free. Village Community Boathouse is a nonprofit organization entirely run by volunteers. While no commitment is required from those who row with us, our facilities, boats and equipment require regular upkeep and repair. Please consider making a donation of money or time to make our programs possible.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About Village Community Boathouse<\/strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.villagecommunityboathouse.org/\">Village Community Boathouse<\/a> is a nonprofit based on Pier 40 at the west end of Houston Street. At the boathouse we build, maintain, and row a fleet of traditional wooden rowboats. Our rowing program on the Hudson uses Whitehall Gigs, 25 foot long boats for four rowers which can handle the conditions and traffic of the harbor.

We serve so many immigrant communities in the park, so to bring together such a diverse roster of faculty makes this program quite special; while the areas of focus are ambitious, the courses will be accessible to all members of our community no matter their level of knowledge on the topic at hand, so we welcome everyone to register and enjoy.&rdquo; <\/p>\n\n<p>The program will take place in the former Rose Garden, located in the northeast corner of Prospect Park, <a href=\"https://www.prospectpark.org/learn-more/reimagine-prospect-park-rose-garden/\">an area that has been the focus of community visioning sessions as part of Prospect Park Alliance&rsquo;s plans for the restoration of this area of the park.<\/a> <\/p>\n\n<p>Following the open call, the Library and the Alliance worked closely with the Library&rsquo;s robust immigration and outreach services team, along with Upwardly Global, Emma&rsquo;s Torch, and World Education Services to bring together a diverse range of professorial candidates. In advance of the lectures, professors will participate in a teacher&rsquo;s training session to help structure the classes. All professors will be compensated for their work. University Open Air will continue with an indoor winter semester and will return to Prospect Park again for a summer semester in 2020, expanding the opportunities for potential professors to share their knowledge with the New York Community. Following last summer&rsquo;s Democracy Lab, the collaboration between the Library and the Alliance broadens both organizations outreach to engage with citizens, as well as serve as a vital resource for Brooklyn&rsquo;s diverse immigrant communities.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 10:00 am<\/p><p>End time: 3:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (718) 965-8951<\/p><p>Location: The Rose Garden<\/p>","parkids":"","parknames":"","start":"2019-06-29 10:00:00","end":"2019-06-29 15:00:00","contact_phone":"(718) 965-8951","location":"The Rose Garden","categories":"Education | Talks","coordinates":"40.66912421916000000, -73.96799683573600000","image":"","pubDate":"Wed, 26 Jun 2019 23:59:28 EDT","pretty_time":"Jun 29 10:00 AM"},{"title":"Central Park Tour: Iconic Views of Central Park","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/06/29/central-park-tour-iconic-views-of-central-park","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/06/29/central-park-tour-iconic-views-of-central-park","description":"<p>Date: June 29, 2019<\/p><p><p>Take our signature tour, and let Central Park Conservancy guides give you an insider&#39;s look at some of the most iconic features of the world&#39;s greatest urban park.

Tunes are those that are typically suitable for contra dancing or other traditional fiddle tunes.<\/p>\n\n<p>This group is intended to provide a musical home for folks interested in playing tunes with other musicians, learning to play by ear and overall increasing their own musical skill. It&rsquo;s fun and welcoming to all ages and levels of playing. While we won&rsquo;t play from sheet music, you can certainly use this as a reference on your own!<br />\n<br />\nWhat do you mean by slow jam? All acoustic instruments (e.g., fiddle, mandolin, guitar, cello, etc.) are welcome and the typical format is that we sit in a circle (or circle-ish, depending on the space) and take turns suggesting/leading a song. The songs will typically follow the AABB format (two &ldquo;A&rdquo; parts followed by two &ldquo;B&rdquo; parts) and we will simply play it over many repeats and if you know it, great, but if you don&rsquo;t, you try to figure it out as we go along, maybe picking up a few notes here and there. We&rsquo;ll play tunes at a slow to moderate speed so that they are accessible to a variety of levels.<br />\n<br />\nIt&rsquo;s fun and can be challenging, but is a great way to improve your playing. You don&rsquo;t have to be a great player, play in tune, or know the songs to give it a shot.

Boats are available on a first-come-first-served basis, no reservations.<\/p>\n\n<p>Rowing is a beautifully simple, healthy, and empowering sport, and the waters of the lake are an ideal place to pursue its pleasures. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Who can participate:<\/strong><br />\nCommunity rowing is open to all, although some physical agility is required to get in and out of the boats. The focus of the program is recreation in a safe and respectful environment. Each adult must sign a waiver; children must be accompanied by a parent. Life jackets are provided&mdash;and must be worn!<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Volunteers<\/strong> are greatly appreciated!

Village Community Boathouse is a nonprofit organization entirely run by volunteers. While no commitment is required from those who row with us, our facilities, boats and equipment require regular upkeep and repair. Please consider making a donation of money or time to make our programs possible.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About Village Community Boathouse<\/strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.villagecommunityboathouse.org/\">Village Community Boathouse<\/a> is a nonprofit based on Pier 40 at the west end of Houston Street. At the boathouse we build, maintain, and row a fleet of traditional wooden rowboats. Our rowing program on the Hudson uses Whitehall Gigs, 25 foot long boats for four rowers which can handle the conditions and traffic of the harbor. We have programs using the smaller boats in Prospect Park in Brooklyn and Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. The boats are traditional handmade wooden rowboats of a variety of designs.

McDaniels created the long-running music video program in 1983, and for the past three decades he&#39;s documented New York&rsquo;s hip-hop scene with the wisdom and reverence of a hip-hop lifer who&#39;s seen it all. At this year&#39;s SummerStage festival he&#39;s hosting a \"Soul Jam,\" joined by two acts from the 1970s that ooze style and swagger. The Philly soul quintet Blue Magic is known for its choreographed dance moves, smooth ballads like the lovesick anthem \"Sideshow\" (1974), and their 1989 collaboration with Big Daddy Kane, \"To Be Your Man\"; DJ Hollywood came to fame as a disco DJ whose call-and-response style of performance pre-dated hip-hop music in the mid-70s. As the first to string together rhymes into a \"flow,\" the glitzy downtown DJ is credited as one of hip-hop&#39;s earliest forefathers, even though he resisted association with the burgeoning scene in the gritty South Bronx.<\/p>\n\n<div> <\/div><\/p><p>Start time: 6:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 9:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: Springfield Park<\/p>","parkids":"Q107","parknames":"Springfield Park","start":"2019-07-06 18:00:00","end":"2019-07-06 21:00:00","location":"Springfield Park","categories":"Concerts | Free Summer Concerts","coordinates":"40.66180038452148400, -73.76159667968750000","image":"","pubDate":"Wed, 26 Jun 2019 23:59:28 EDT","pretty_time":"Jul 06 06:00 PM"},{"title":"Family Camping: Brooklyn","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/06/family-camping-brooklyn","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/06/family-camping-brooklyn","description":"<p>Date: July 6, 2019<\/p><p><p>Camp overnight in Brooklyn&#39;s largest park!<\/p>\n\n<p>We camp to create lasting memories, connect with the natural world, and bond with our families.

This tour will follow the park&rsquo;s scenic watercourse and delve into how Prospect Park Alliance maintains and supports this complex system. The tour will end with a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most unique features of the park: the 1869 Wellhouse, the park&rsquo;s last remaining building by park designer Calvert Vaux, which once housed the machinery that fueled the  watercourse and was recently restored by the Alliance and converted into the first composting restrooms in a NYC park.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Art & Architecture Tour (3rd Sundays): <\/strong>For over 150 years, Prospect Park has been a showcase for beautiful public buildings and artwork, with representations from eras including Beaux-Arts, City Beautiful, the New Deal Modernism, and contemporary LEED-certified projects.
