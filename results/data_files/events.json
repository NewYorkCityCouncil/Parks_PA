Your child will learn about the Van Cortlandt Family&rsquo;s and New York City&rsquo;s important roles in the formation of our country all while having fun.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About Adventures in Time Summer History Camp<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Adventures in Time Summer History Camp is open to all children with a sense of adventure who have completed 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th grade (or the equivalent) in the Spring of 2018.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Campers are immersed in the everyday life of a child in the 18th century as they wear period-style clothing and make and play with 18th-century toys and games. Typical chores such as churning butter, cooking, gathering wood, and hauling water are all part of the full History Camp experience. Children will also travel in time back to the early years of the Revolutionary War and experience the life of a soldier in General George Washington&rsquo;s army. They will lend a hand with pitching tents and setting up camp. &ldquo;Enlistment&rdquo; in the army, military drill, and reconnaissance are also part of the action.<\/p>\n\n<p>The camp is lead by Van Cortlandt House Museum&rsquo;s professional staff, talented living history volunteers, and college students studying material culture and history. Daily activities for  Adventures in Time Summer History Camp are designed in keeping with New York State 4th grade curriculum standards and are appropriate for children ages 6 - 12.  Campers bring their own lunches but Van Cortlandt House Museum provides daily snacks and drinking water.   Adventures in Time is a technology-free experience. Campers may bring a cell phone with them to camp but all phones will be left with the administrative staff in the Welcome Center/Office during camp hours. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Registration<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>We encourage early enrollment, as camp space is limited and enrolls on a first-come, first-served basis.

It will test their courage, creativity and Master Building skills, and reveal just how special they really are.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sponsored by Council Member Paul Vallone.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 8:15 pm<\/p><p>End time: 9:45 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (718) 352-4793<\/p><p>Location: 35th Avenue and Cross Island Parkway (in Crocheron Park)<\/p>","parkids":"Q012","parknames":"Crocheron Park","start":"2019-08-16 20:15:00","end":"2019-08-16 21:45:00","contact_phone":"(718) 352-4793","location":"35th Avenue and Cross Island Parkway (in Crocheron Park)","categories":"Accessible | Film | Best for Kids | Free Summer Movies","coordinates":"40.77134323120117000, -73.76530456542969000","image":"","pubDate":"Thu, 15 Aug 2019 00:00:28 EDT","pretty_time":"Aug 16 08:15 PM"},{"title":"Hudson RiverFlicks - Animated Favorites: How to Train Your Dragon 3: The Hidden World","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/08/16/hudson-riverflicks-friday","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/08/16/hudson-riverflicks-friday","description":"<p>Date: August 16, 2019<\/p><p><p>This summer HRPK is once again bringing family favorites to your west side backyard!

After they complete half of their face they will get with a partner. First they will meditate with their backs supporting one another focusing on the breath. The purpose is to tune into the interconnected energy that resides within them both. Being mindful of their internal space as well as their partner&rsquo;s internal space. After 5 min, they will turn to face one another and soul gaze. After 5 min partner A will complete the other half of partner B&rsquo;s face. After partner B&rsquo;s face is complete they will do the same for partner A.

How can we connect with nature in a society that continues to give primacy to disposability and mass-consumption? How do we move away from a mindset of scarcity to one of collaboration? How can we be transformed from the egocentric &ldquo;i&rdquo; to the love supreme &ldquo;I AM&rdquo;?  In this work, artist Tattfoo Tan uses participatory prompts, games and affirmations to engage you in the play of the universe. Let the process begin.<\/p>\n\n<p>Staten Island based artist Tattfoo Tan&rsquo;s practice focuses on issues relating to ecology, sustainability and healthy living. His work is project-based, ephemeral and educational in nature. Tan has exhibited at venues including the Queens Museum of Art, Eugene Lang College at the New School for Liberal Arts, Parsons the New School for Design, the Fashion Institute of Technology, Wave Hill, Macalester College, Ballroom Marfa, Creative Time, Project Row Houses, and the Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati. Tan&rsquo;s projects have been presented by the Laundromat Project, the City of New York Department of Cultural Affairs Percent for the Arts program, and the City of Philadelphia Mural Arts program. His work has been published by Gestalten and Thames and Hudson.<\/p>\n\n<p>Tan has been widely recognized for his artistic contributions and service to the community, and is the proud recipient of a proclamation from The City of New York. He is the recipient of grants from Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, Art Matters, Joan Mitchell Foundation, the Pulitzer Arts Foundation, and Staten Island Arts.  In 2010, Tan received the annual Award for Excellence in Design by the Public Design Commission of the City of New York for his design and branding of the Super-Graphic on Bronx River Art Center. He currently serves on the Mayor&rsquo;s Citizens&rsquo; Advisory Committee to support the development of a Comprehensive Cultural Plan.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>All exhibits and programs are located in the Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art (Buildings C & G).

Typical chores such as churning butter, cooking, gathering wood, and hauling water are all part of the full History Camp experience. Children will also travel in time back to the early years of the Revolutionary War and experience the life of a soldier in General George Washington&rsquo;s army. They will lend a hand with pitching tents and setting up camp. &ldquo;Enlistment&rdquo; in the army, military drill, and reconnaissance are also part of the action.<\/p>\n\n<p>The camp is lead by Van Cortlandt House Museum&rsquo;s professional staff, talented living history volunteers, and college students studying material culture and history. Daily activities for  Adventures in Time Summer History Camp are designed in keeping with New York State 4th grade curriculum standards and are appropriate for children ages 6 - 12.  Campers bring their own lunches but Van Cortlandt House Museum provides daily snacks and drinking water.   Adventures in Time is a technology-free experience. Campers may bring a cell phone with them to camp but all phones will be left with the administrative staff in the Welcome Center/Office during camp hours. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Registration<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>We encourage early enrollment, as camp space is limited and enrolls on a first-come, first-served basis.

Your child will learn about the Van Cortlandt Family&rsquo;s and New York City&rsquo;s important roles in the formation of our country all while having fun.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About Adventures in Time Summer History Camp<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Adventures in Time Summer History Camp is open to all children with a sense of adventure who have completed 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th grade (or the equivalent) in the Spring of 2018.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Campers are immersed in the everyday life of a child in the 18th century as they wear period-style clothing and make and play with 18th-century toys and games. Typical chores such as churning butter, cooking, gathering wood, and hauling water are all part of the full History Camp experience. Children will also travel in time back to the early years of the Revolutionary War and experience the life of a soldier in General George Washington&rsquo;s army. They will lend a hand with pitching tents and setting up camp. &ldquo;Enlistment&rdquo; in the army, military drill, and reconnaissance are also part of the action.<\/p>\n\n<p>The camp is lead by Van Cortlandt House Museum&rsquo;s professional staff, talented living history volunteers, and college students studying material culture and history. Daily activities for  Adventures in Time Summer History Camp are designed in keeping with New York State 4th grade curriculum standards and are appropriate for children ages 6 - 12.  Campers bring their own lunches but Van Cortlandt House Museum provides daily snacks and drinking water.   Adventures in Time is a technology-free experience. Campers may bring a cell phone with them to camp but all phones will be left with the administrative staff in the Welcome Center/Office during camp hours. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Registration<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>We encourage early enrollment, as camp space is limited and enrolls on a first-come, first-served basis.

Typical chores such as churning butter, cooking, gathering wood, and hauling water are all part of the full History Camp experience. Children will also travel in time back to the early years of the Revolutionary War and experience the life of a soldier in General George Washington&rsquo;s army. They will lend a hand with pitching tents and setting up camp. &ldquo;Enlistment&rdquo; in the army, military drill, and reconnaissance are also part of the action.<\/p>\n\n<p>The camp is lead by Van Cortlandt House Museum&rsquo;s professional staff, talented living history volunteers, and college students studying material culture and history. Daily activities for  Adventures in Time Summer History Camp are designed in keeping with New York State 4th grade curriculum standards and are appropriate for children ages 6 - 12.  Campers bring their own lunches but Van Cortlandt House Museum provides daily snacks and drinking water.   Adventures in Time is a technology-free experience. Campers may bring a cell phone with them to camp but all phones will be left with the administrative staff in the Welcome Center/Office during camp hours. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Registration<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>We encourage early enrollment, as camp space is limited and enrolls on a first-come, first-served basis.

Typical chores such as churning butter, cooking, gathering wood, and hauling water are all part of the full History Camp experience. Children will also travel in time back to the early years of the Revolutionary War and experience the life of a soldier in General George Washington&rsquo;s army. They will lend a hand with pitching tents and setting up camp. &ldquo;Enlistment&rdquo; in the army, military drill, and reconnaissance are also part of the action.<\/p>\n\n<p>The camp is lead by Van Cortlandt House Museum&rsquo;s professional staff, talented living history volunteers, and college students studying material culture and history. Daily activities for  Adventures in Time Summer History Camp are designed in keeping with New York State 4th grade curriculum standards and are appropriate for children ages 6 - 12.  Campers bring their own lunches but Van Cortlandt House Museum provides daily snacks and drinking water.   Adventures in Time is a technology-free experience. Campers may bring a cell phone with them to camp but all phones will be left with the administrative staff in the Welcome Center/Office during camp hours. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Registration<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>We encourage early enrollment, as camp space is limited and enrolls on a first-come, first-served basis.

Typical chores such as churning butter, cooking, gathering wood, and hauling water are all part of the full History Camp experience. Children will also travel in time back to the early years of the Revolutionary War and experience the life of a soldier in General George Washington&rsquo;s army. They will lend a hand with pitching tents and setting up camp. &ldquo;Enlistment&rdquo; in the army, military drill, and reconnaissance are also part of the action.<\/p>\n\n<p>The camp is lead by Van Cortlandt House Museum&rsquo;s professional staff, talented living history volunteers, and college students studying material culture and history. Daily activities for  Adventures in Time Summer History Camp are designed in keeping with New York State 4th grade curriculum standards and are appropriate for children ages 6 - 12.  Campers bring their own lunches but Van Cortlandt House Museum provides daily snacks and drinking water.   Adventures in Time is a technology-free experience. Campers may bring a cell phone with them to camp but all phones will be left with the administrative staff in the Welcome Center/Office during camp hours. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Registration<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>We encourage early enrollment, as camp space is limited and enrolls on a first-come, first-served basis.

Our rowing program on the Hudson uses Whitehall Gigs, 25 foot long boats for four rowers which can handle the conditions and traffic of the harbor. We have programs using the smaller boats in Prospect Park in Brooklyn and Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. The boats are traditional handmade wooden rowboats of a variety of designs. Some of them were built at Pier 40 as part of our Community Boatbuilding program.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 4:30 pm<\/p><p>End time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: South end of lake (in Van Cortlandt Park)<\/p>","parkids":"X092","parknames":"Van Cortlandt Park","start":"2019-08-23 16:30:00","end":"2019-08-23 19:00:00","location":"South end of lake (in Van Cortlandt Park)","categories":"Nature | Kayaking and Canoeing","coordinates":"40.88915215898600000, -73.89286369085300000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5cfbcfad32cca.JPG","pubDate":"Thu, 15 Aug 2019 00:00:28 EDT","pretty_time":"Aug 23 04:30 PM"},{"title":"Summer on the Hudson: Breathing with Strangers, presented by Kinesis Project Dance Theatre","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/08/23/summer-on-the-hudson-breathing-with-strangers-presented-by-kinesis-project-dance-theatre","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/08/23/summer-on-the-hudson-breathing-with-strangers-presented-by-kinesis-project-dance-theatre","description":"<p>Date: August 23, 2019<\/p><p><p>Melissa Riker and <a href=\"https://kinesisproject.squarespace.com/\">Kinesis Project Dance Theatre<\/a> presents the site-specific company&rsquo;s newest large-scale outdoor dance performance&mdash;a ragged, sweeping and surprising love-song to New York City.

The tour will end with a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most unique features of the park: the 1869 Wellhouse, the park&rsquo;s last remaining building by park designer Calvert Vaux, which once housed the machinery that fueled the  watercourse and was recently restored by the Alliance and converted into the first composting restrooms in a NYC park.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Art & Architecture Tour (3rd Sundays): <\/strong>For over 150 years, Prospect Park has been a showcase for beautiful public buildings and artwork, with representations from eras including Beaux-Arts, City Beautiful, the New Deal Modernism, and contemporary LEED-certified projects.

The Savannah, Georgia native has performed extensively on trumpet as a bandleader and sideman with some of the world&rsquo;s finest up-and-coming and veteran jazz musicians. Nguyen has appeared at notable New York City venues such as Birdland, Kitano, Iridium, Mezzrow, Lincoln Center, the Metropolitan Museum, and has had the opportunity to perform throughout Europe, Asia, and the United States. He is the winner of the International Trumpet Guild Jazz Competition, and Jamey Aebersold Award for Artistry at the National Trumpet Competition.<\/p>\n\n<p>Nguyen&rsquo;s contributions as a composer and arranger span from choral music to big band. His composition &ldquo;The First Year&rdquo; was featured on NEA Jazz Master Kenny Barron&rsquo;s album The Traveler. He was selected as a composer/performer for residencies at Betty Carter&rsquo;s Jazz Ahead at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., and Ravinia&#39;s Steans Music Institute in Chicago. In the realm of sacred music, Nguyen has composed and arranged numerous works for choir and other ensembles, and blended traditional hymns, spirituals, jazz and gospel at St George&rsquo;s Church, where he previously worked as music director. Seeking to cultivate a community around music, Nguyen has programmed a variety of musical events from communal singing, to jazz clubs and concert series, providing musicians opportunities to premiere new projects to appreciative audiences.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/jazz-in-the-park-with-alex-nguyen-friends-tickets-62829897916\">Get tickets<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Any cancellation will be posted on our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/820912941627424/\">Facebook page<\/a>.
