Wear comfortable clothing and bring water. <\/p>\n\n<p>Exercising with a view, in natural sunlight, with green scenery all around bestow health benefits that can&rsquo;t be found indoors.

McDaniels created the long-running music video program in 1983, and for the past three decades he&#39;s documented New York&rsquo;s hip-hop scene with the wisdom and reverence of a hip-hop lifer who&#39;s seen it all. At this year&#39;s SummerStage festival he&#39;s hosting a \"Soul Jam,\" joined by two acts from the 1970s that ooze style and swagger. The Philly soul quintet Blue Magic is known for its choreographed dance moves, smooth ballads like the lovesick anthem \"Sideshow\" (1974), and their 1989 collaboration with Big Daddy Kane, \"To Be Your Man\"; DJ Hollywood came to fame as a disco DJ whose call-and-response style of performance pre-dated hip-hop music in the mid-70s. As the first to string together rhymes into a \"flow,\" the glitzy downtown DJ is credited as one of hip-hop&#39;s earliest forefathers, even though he resisted association with the burgeoning scene in the gritty South Bronx.<\/p>\n\n<div> <\/div><\/p><p>Start time: 6:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 9:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: Springfield Park<\/p>","parkids":"Q107","parknames":"Springfield Park","start":"2019-07-06 18:00:00","end":"2019-07-06 21:00:00","location":"Springfield Park","categories":"Concerts | Free Summer Concerts","coordinates":"40.66180038452148400, -73.76159667968750000","image":"","pubDate":"Fri, 05 Jul 2019 00:00:07 EDT","pretty_time":"Jul 06 06:00 PM"},{"title":"Family Camping: Brooklyn","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/06/family-camping-brooklyn","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/06/family-camping-brooklyn","description":"<p>Date: July 6, 2019<\/p><p><p>Camp overnight in Brooklyn&#39;s largest park!<\/p>\n\n<p>We camp to create lasting memories, connect with the natural world, and bond with our families.

Through the lens of a Black femme figure, this visual essay uses gesture, choreography, and text to address an increasing presence of anhedonia today, as it pertains to the denial of the pleasure of making mistakes: the joy of being bad and wrong.<\/p>\n\n<p>Autumn Knight creates performances and videos that examine and reframe oversimplified ideas about race, gender, history, and marginalized peoples. Much of her works centers around consumption, namely, the ways we take in and are taken in by one another. At once revolting and intriguing, Knight explores the tension between desire and disgust, and the ways in which those on the margins are often trapped between these polarities. Much of Knight&rsquo;s recent work is inspired by bell hooks&rsquo; essay &ldquo;Eating the Other: Desire and Resistance,&rdquo; and hooks&rsquo; analysis of the ways we understand, control, realize, and resist power.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 8:30 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 206-9922<\/p><p>Location: On the High Line at 14th Street (in The High Line)<\/p>","parkids":"M360","parknames":"The High Line","start":"2019-07-11 19:00:00","end":"2019-07-11 20:30:00","contact_phone":"(212) 206-9922","location":"On the High Line at 14th Street (in The High Line)","categories":"Art | Talks","coordinates":"40.74166061574600000, -74.00767326355000000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5d0a7887df317.png","pubDate":"Fri, 05 Jul 2019 00:00:07 EDT","pretty_time":"Jul 11 07:00 PM"},{"title":"The Power Is You","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/11/the-power-is-you","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/11/the-power-is-you","description":"<p>Date: July 11, 2019<\/p><p><p>Led by Gary M.

At the boathouse we build, maintain, and row a fleet of traditional wooden rowboats. Our rowing program on the Hudson uses Whitehall Gigs, 25 foot long boats for four rowers which can handle the conditions and traffic of the harbor. We have programs using the smaller boats in Prospect Park in Brooklyn and Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. The boats are traditional handmade wooden rowboats of a variety of designs. Some of them were built at Pier 40 as part of our Community Boatbuilding program.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 4:30 pm<\/p><p>End time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: South end of lake (in Van Cortlandt Park)<\/p>","parkids":"X092","parknames":"Van Cortlandt Park","start":"2019-07-12 16:30:00","end":"2019-07-12 19:00:00","location":"South end of lake (in Van Cortlandt Park)","categories":"Nature | Kayaking and Canoeing","coordinates":"40.88915215898600000, -73.89286369085300000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5cfbcfad32cca.JPG","pubDate":"Fri, 05 Jul 2019 00:00:07 EDT","pretty_time":"Jul 12 04:30 PM"},{"title":"Kayak Staten Island","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/12/kayak-staten-island","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/12/kayak-staten-island","description":"<p>Date: July 12, 2019<\/p><p><p>Join Kayak Staten Island for free public kayaking off the shore at Conference House Park! <\/p>\n\n<p>Boats and life jackets will be provided for a short paddle.

The tour will end with a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most unique features of the park: the 1869 Wellhouse, the park&rsquo;s last remaining building by park designer Calvert Vaux, which once housed the machinery that fueled the  watercourse and was recently restored by the Alliance and converted into the first composting restrooms in a NYC park.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Art & Architecture Tour (3rd Sundays): <\/strong>For over 150 years, Prospect Park has been a showcase for beautiful public buildings and artwork, with representations from eras including Beaux-Arts, City Beautiful, the New Deal Modernism, and contemporary LEED-certified projects.

Additional support is provided by the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs and the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York State Legislature.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 9:00 am<\/p><p>End time: 5:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 360-8163<\/p><p>Location: Arsenal (in Central Park)<\/p>","parkids":"M010","parknames":"Central Park","start":"2019-07-15 09:00:00","end":"2019-07-15 17:00:00","contact_phone":"(212) 360-8163","location":"Arsenal (in Central Park)","categories":"Accessible | Art | History | Seniors","coordinates":"40.76720046997100000, -73.97129821777300000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5cf68d2f78c67.jpeg","pubDate":"Fri, 05 Jul 2019 00:00:07 EDT","pretty_time":"Jul 15 09:00 AM"},{"title":"Summer Open Village","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/15/summer-open-village","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/15/summer-open-village","description":"<p>Date: July 15, 2019<\/p><p><p>Historic Richmond Town&rsquo;s Main Village site comes alive with the sights, sounds, tastes, and smells of New York City&rsquo;s rural past!<\/p>\n\n<p>Visit skilled artisans as they practice their trade, tour the restored interiors of period homes, take part in civic life, and browse working shops and functioning open hearth kitchens.<\/p>\n\n<p>Be a part of your community past, present, and future!

Boats are available on a first-come-first-served basis, no reservations.<\/p>\n\n<p>Rowing is a beautifully simple, healthy, and empowering sport, and the waters of the lake are an ideal place to pursue its pleasures. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Who can participate:<\/strong><br />\nCommunity rowing is open to all, although some physical agility is required to get in and out of the boats. The focus of the program is recreation in a safe and respectful environment. Each adult must sign a waiver; children must be accompanied by a parent. Life jackets are provided&mdash;and must be worn!<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Volunteers<\/strong> are greatly appreciated!

Village Community Boathouse is a nonprofit organization entirely run by volunteers. While no commitment is required from those who row with us, our facilities, boats and equipment require regular upkeep and repair.

At the boathouse we build, maintain, and row a fleet of traditional wooden rowboats. Our rowing program on the Hudson uses Whitehall Gigs, 25 foot long boats for four rowers which can handle the conditions and traffic of the harbor. We have programs using the smaller boats in Prospect Park in Brooklyn and Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. The boats are traditional handmade wooden rowboats of a variety of designs. Some of them were built at Pier 40 as part of our Community Boatbuilding program.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 4:30 pm<\/p><p>End time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: South end of lake (in Van Cortlandt Park)<\/p>","parkids":"X092","parknames":"Van Cortlandt Park","start":"2019-07-19 16:30:00","end":"2019-07-19 19:00:00","location":"South end of lake (in Van Cortlandt Park)","categories":"Nature | Kayaking and Canoeing","coordinates":"40.88915215898600000, -73.89286369085300000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5cfbcfad32cca.JPG","pubDate":"Fri, 05 Jul 2019 00:00:07 EDT","pretty_time":"Jul 19 04:30 PM"},{"title":"Picnic & Play","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/19/picnic-play","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/07/19/picnic-play","description":"<p>Date: July 19, 2019<\/p><p><p>Bring out your family and friends for fun games like giant Connect 4, Jenga, and more.
