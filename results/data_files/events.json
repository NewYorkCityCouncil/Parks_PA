We will read and share stories of the Aquacade to re-create a vivid picture of these dynamic shows, and to re-imagine the former aquatic amphitheater on the current footprint of the POOLTIME installation.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>5:00 p.m. - 6:00 p.m. - Interpretive Synchronized Swimming Movement Workshop*<\/strong><br />\nThe Synchronized Swimming Workshop reimagines the choreography used in synchronized swimming routines of the Aquacade as an out-of-water experience.

Until her mid-twenties, she experimented with dance and movement, searched through travel, and immersed herself in philosophy. All her classes are infused with the wish that every person connects to their inner self and finds the space to live fully.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About POOLTIME<\/strong><br />\nPOOLTIME is a site-specific public art pavilion by artists Cheryl Wing-Zi Wong and Dev Harlan. It is also a series of community programming that pays homage to the historic Aquacade aquatic amphitheater and centers around the rich history of the Park as a site for the 1939 and 1964 World&rsquo;s Fairs. Now demolished and largely forgotten, the project highlights the Aquacade&#39;s history as a vibrant site for working-class families to convene and aims to discuss the World&rsquo;s Fair structures and their architectural lives and meaning post-exhibition.<\/p>\n\n<p>As a dynamic sculpture, POOLTIME activates an underused public space and also acts as a sundial, whose shadows track the hours of a day, while the pavers tell a story about the landscape transformations over the decades.

From there, his experimentations grew and by the late 1970s, Laraaji started busking with his new sound on the sidewalks of New York. Brian Eno discovered Laraaji in Washington Square Park and released &ldquo;Ambient 3: Day of Radiance,&rdquo; the third installment of Brian Eno&rsquo;s Ambient Series.

And, it&#39;s an affordable way to increase physical activity opportunities, because there&#39;s nothing special to build.<\/p>\n\n<p>Exercise with a view, in natural sunlight, with green scenery all around bestows health benefits that can&rsquo;t be found indoors. Scientific studies have shown that the pleasure of being outdoors for example gives your brain, psyche, and immune system an extra boost.<\/p>\n\n<p>All of our fitness programs are free, led by trained professionals, and suitable for all levels. Wear comfortable clothing and bring water. Please check back for rain and weather/air advisory cancels.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Please note: <\/strong>Fitness programs are canceled if the weather is lower than 20 degrees and when there are icy conditions.

Tunes are those that are typically suitable for contra dancing or other traditional fiddle tunes.<\/p>\n\n<p>This group is intended to provide a musical home for folks interested in playing tunes with other musicians, learning to play by ear and overall increasing their own musical skill. It&rsquo;s fun and welcoming to all ages and levels of playing. While we won&rsquo;t play from sheet music, you can certainly use this as a reference on your own!<br />\n<br />\nWhat do you mean by slow jam? All acoustic instruments (e.g., fiddle, mandolin, guitar, cello, etc.) are welcome and the typical format is that we sit in a circle (or circle-ish, depending on the space) and take turns suggesting/leading a song. The songs will typically follow the AABB format (two &ldquo;A&rdquo; parts followed by two &ldquo;B&rdquo; parts) and we will simply play it over many repeats and if you know it, great, but if you don&rsquo;t, you try to figure it out as we go along, maybe picking up a few notes here and there. We&rsquo;ll play tunes at a slow to moderate speed so that they are accessible to a variety of levels.<br />\n<br />\nIt&rsquo;s fun and can be challenging, but is a great way to improve your playing. You don&rsquo;t have to be a great player, play in tune, or know the songs to give it a shot.

After moving to New York and spending years in the salsa scene here, he formed Grupo Ir&eacute;k with Hensy Perez, Tosso Hettinger, and Heriberto Valentin, and made his first recording as a bandleader with them in 2008. It was during this period that Grupo Ir&eacute;k became one of the best-known and most respected Salsa acts on the New York City circuit. Chino also began playing every year at the Vanidades Magazine anniversary party&mdash;previously honoring such classic entertainers as Gloria Estefan, Paquito de Rivera, Ruben Blades, and Juan Luis Guerra.

Village Community Boathouse is a nonprofit organization entirely run by volunteers. While no commitment is required from those who row with us, our facilities, boats and equipment require regular upkeep and repair. Please consider making a donation of money or time to make our programs possible.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About Village Community Boathouse<\/strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.villagecommunityboathouse.org/\">Village Community Boathouse<\/a> is a nonprofit based on Pier 40 at the west end of Houston Street. At the boathouse we build, maintain, and row a fleet of traditional wooden rowboats. Our rowing program on the Hudson uses Whitehall Gigs, 25 foot long boats for four rowers which can handle the conditions and traffic of the harbor. We have programs using the smaller boats in Prospect Park in Brooklyn and Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. The boats are traditional handmade wooden rowboats of a variety of designs. Some of them were built at Pier 40 as part of our Community Boatbuilding program.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 4:30 pm<\/p><p>End time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: South end of lake (in Van Cortlandt Park)<\/p>","parkids":"X092","parknames":"Van Cortlandt Park","start":"2019-08-09 16:30:00","end":"2019-08-09 19:00:00","location":"South end of lake (in Van Cortlandt Park)","categories":"Nature | Kayaking and Canoeing","coordinates":"40.88915215898600000, -73.89286369085300000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5cfbcfad32cca.JPG","pubDate":"Sat, 27 Jul 2019 00:00:48 EDT","pretty_time":"Aug 09 04:30 PM"},{"title":"Carnegie Hall Citywide Night","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/08/09/carnegie-hall-citywide-citywide-night","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/08/09/carnegie-hall-citywide-citywide-night","description":"<p>Date: August 9, 2019<\/p><p><p>Experience world-class performing arts while enjoying a summer picnic. <\/p>\n\n<p>This four-hour finale to the Carnegie Citywide concert series features Matuto, Eileen Ivers, and Nathan & the Zydeco Cha Chas. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Matuto<\/strong>, &ldquo;country boy&rdquo; in Brazilian slang, has been described as &ldquo;weird and wonderful &hellip; unorthodox and delightful&rdquo; by JazzTimes magazine. You&rsquo;ll hear why when this lively quartet takes Brazilian folk music and shakes it up with the flatpicking guitars and fiery fiddles of American bluegrass to create a musical experience Matuto likens to &ldquo;Brazilian Carnival in the Appalachian Mountains.&rdquo; Anchored by the guitar of Clay Ross and accordion of Rob Curto, Matuto&rsquo;s joyous explorations of every folk, world, and jazz style are invigorating.<\/p>\n\n<p>Consider every possibility for what&rsquo;s exciting and daring in Irish fiddle playing and <strong>Eileen Ivers<\/strong> surpasses them. This Grammy Award winner, Emmy nominated, and nine-time All-Ireland Fiddle Champion has played with major orchestras around the globe as well as such luminaries as Sting, the Chieftains, Patti Smith, and countless others. Called &ldquo;the Jimi Hendrix of the violin&rdquo; (The New York Times), she is deeply rooted in tradition while remaining dedicated to exploring new possibilities for the instrument.<\/p>\n\n<p>Zydeco, that intoxicating accordion-driven South Louisiana-rooted blend of Cajun, Afro-Caribbean, and African-American popular music, burns brightly when <strong>Nathan and the Zydeco Cha Chas <\/strong>perform. Nathan Williams&rsquo;s accordion playing sets the boisterous tone while his brother Dennis&rsquo;s jazz-tinged guitar brings a unique flavor to the music. Bass, drums, and rubboard add extra spice to this Louisiana-styled musical gumbo for a performance that will get your feet moving, fingers snapping, and heart-pounding.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Photo Credit: Angelito Jusay.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>As part of Picnic Performances presented by Bank of America, this event is free and open to the public with no tickets and no lines.

They have been making music together as a quartet for several years. Three of them live in North Carolina and one has moved back to Rochester. Their songs often seek out dark lairs within which terrible monsters dwell, but Their mission is to retrieve the treasure from the dark lair & persuade the terrible monsters inside to seek out the path of redemption. As Axl Rose once memorably asked, in the song \"terrible monster\": \"what&#39;s so terrible about monsters, anyway?\" This is the question the Mountain Goats have been doggedly pursuing since 1991. They will never leave off this quest until every option has been exhausted.
