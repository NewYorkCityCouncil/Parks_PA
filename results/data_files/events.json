In conjunction with NYC Parks, the pavilion will be installed at the north end of Meadow Lake in Flushing Meadows Corona Park this summer 2019. POOLTIME is a public pavilion and series of community programming centered around the rich history of the Park as a site for the 1939 and 1964 World&rsquo;s Fairs. POOLTIME activates an underused public space and aims to discuss the World&rsquo;s Fair structures and their architectural lives and meaning post-exhibition.<\/p>\n\n<p>This public art pavilion pays homage to the historic Aquacade aquatic amphitheater constructed for the 1939 World&rsquo;s Fair, whose structures transformed Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. The amphitheater was reused and activated during the 1964 World&rsquo;s Fair held in New York. Now demolished and largely forgotten, the Aquacade aquatic amphitheater was a large community hub and heart of the park even decades after many of the other World&rsquo;s Fair attractions had fallen into decay and disuse.

At the age of 11, Rokafella had thus far found her step and was on the path of becoming a B-Girl. Garcia is not only a renowned dancer but also a poet, musician, filmmaker, and entrepreneur. Rokafella is also regarded as the pioneer for the new generation of B-Girls and B-Boys. Raised in Spanish Harlem by Puerto Rican immigrants, Garcia grew up seeing hip hop performed in her own neighborhood during the late 1970s and &#39;80s. In 1991, veteran breakdancer Kwikstep took Garcia on as a mentee. She would go on to dance with many crews in New York City including The Transformers, The Breeze Team, and the New York City Float Committee. With her now-husband, Kwikstep, Rokafella co-founded and performs with the non-profit hip-hop dance company Full Circle Productions to empower young dancers through the positive power of hip-hop.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>DJ Perly <\/strong>is a female Puerto Rican Russian American DK who plays hip hop, breaks, and house music, and practices the art of turntablism with a passion.

The forest-like structure is illuminated with internal lights; voice tubes invite people to whisper to each other from across the sculpture; and for the opening, a soundscape by poet Nicole Celeste Anderson will guide participants in contemplating life in symbiosis. Our budding understanding of the mycorrhiza phenomenon makes humans and plants seem more similar. This network is reminiscent of human neurons, the internet, even our network of roads connecting cities. Through \"Whispers in the Grove,\" artists Kathy Creutzburg, Natalia Lesniak, and Mirabai Kwan Yin seek to pique the public&#39;s interest in science and nature, as well as fostering a sense of interconnection between humans and plants, leading to responsible conservation efforts and sustainable practices.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Whispers in the Grove\" is made possible in part with public funds from Creative Engagement, supported by the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in partnership with the City Council, and administered by LMCC.

Tours begin at the Brooklyn Public Library at Grand Army Plaza.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Hidden Treasures Tour (1st Sundays):<\/strong> Explore some of the little-known corners of Prospect Park in this tour that uncovers some of the park&rsquo;s hidden treasures. Once prime attractions, these areas are currently the focus of Prospect Park Alliance restoration efforts to revitalize the park. The tour includes the Rose Garden and Vale of Cashmere in the park&rsquo;s northeast corner, and well as a guided walk through Brooklyn&rsquo;s last remaining forest, the 150-acre Ravine.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Waterways & Wellhouse Tour (2nd Sundays): <\/strong>Prospect Park is an engineering marvel, designed around an ingenious drainage system and a chain of manmade streams and ponds that terminate in Brooklyn&rsquo;s largest lake. This tour will follow the park&rsquo;s scenic watercourse and delve into how Prospect Park Alliance maintains and supports this complex system. The tour will end with a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most unique features of the park: the 1869 Wellhouse, the park&rsquo;s last remaining building by park designer Calvert Vaux, which once housed the machinery that fueled the  watercourse and was recently restored by the Alliance and converted into the first composting restrooms in a NYC park.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Art & Architecture Tour (3rd Sundays): <\/strong>For over 150 years, Prospect Park has been a showcase for beautiful public buildings and artwork, with representations from eras including Beaux-Arts, City Beautiful, the New Deal Modernism, and contemporary LEED-certified projects.

Additional support is provided by the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs and the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York State Legislature.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 9:00 am<\/p><p>End time: 5:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 360-8163<\/p><p>Location: Arsenal (in Central Park)<\/p>","parkids":"M010","parknames":"Central Park","start":"2019-06-19 09:00:00","end":"2019-06-19 17:00:00","contact_phone":"(212) 360-8163","location":"Arsenal (in Central Park)","categories":"Accessible | Art | History | Seniors","coordinates":"40.76720046997100000, -73.97129821777300000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5cf68d2f78c67.jpeg","pubDate":"Fri, 07 Jun 2019 23:59:53 EDT","pretty_time":"Jun 19 09:00 AM"},{"title":"Summer Open Village","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/06/19/summer-open-village","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/06/19/summer-open-village","description":"<p>Date: June 19, 2019<\/p><p><p>Historic Richmond Town&rsquo;s Main Village site comes alive with the sights, sounds, tastes, and smells of New York City&rsquo;s rural past!<\/p>\n\n<p>Visit skilled artisans as they practice their trade, tour the restored interiors of period homes, take part in civic life, and browse working shops and functioning open hearth kitchens.<\/p>\n\n<p>Be a part of your community past, present, and future!

Our rowing program on the Hudson uses Whitehall Gigs, 25 foot long boats for four rowers which can handle the conditions and traffic of the harbor. We have programs using the smaller boats in Prospect Park in Brooklyn and Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. The boats are traditional handmade wooden rowboats of a variety of designs. Some of them were built at Pier 40 as part of our Community Boatbuilding program.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 4:30 pm<\/p><p>End time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: South end of lake (in Van Cortlandt Park)<\/p>","parkids":"X092","parknames":"Van Cortlandt Park","start":"2019-06-21 16:30:00","end":"2019-06-21 19:00:00","location":"South end of lake (in Van Cortlandt Park)","categories":"Nature | Kayaking and Canoeing","coordinates":"40.88915215898600000, -73.89286369085300000","image":"","pubDate":"Fri, 07 Jun 2019 23:59:53 EDT","pretty_time":"Jun 21 04:30 PM"},{"title":"Summer on the Hudson: Make Music New York","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/06/21/summer-on-the-hudson-make-music-new-york","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/06/21/summer-on-the-hudson-make-music-new-york","description":"<p>Date: June 21, 2019<\/p><p><p><em>On the Waterfront: American Music for Piano Duet<\/em> highlights American four-hand piano music played by young students and professional adult headliners.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 5:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 870-3070<\/p><p>Location: Pier I (in Riverside Park South)<\/p>","parkids":"M353","parknames":"Riverside Park South","start":"2019-06-21 17:00:00","end":"2019-06-21 19:00:00","contact_phone":"(212) 870-3070","location":"Pier I (in Riverside Park South)","categories":"Concerts | Waterfront","coordinates":"40.77970123291000000, -73.98889923095700000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5c784f7d1cee7.JPG","pubDate":"Fri, 07 Jun 2019 23:59:53 EDT","pretty_time":"Jun 21 05:00 PM"},{"title":"Quiet Clubbing at Highland Park","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/06/21/quiet-clubbing","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/06/21/quiet-clubbing","description":"<p>Date: June 21, 2019<\/p><p><p>This family-friendly headphone party has music from every generation to enjoy.

His earliest musical memories were of gypsies playing their guitars for coins on the Venetian cobblestone streets. In 2009, he formed the band &ldquo;Stray Blue&rdquo; and toured throughout Crete, premiering one of the first Indie-Rock band tours on the island.<\/p>\n\n<p>Known for his wild, expressive hair&mdash;which incidentally serves as his namesake&mdash;it symbolizes uninhibited freedom, a tangible representation of childhood rebellion extended into adulthood.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now based in Brooklyn, he offers audiences the chance to experience his Indie-Rock through stirring lyrics, expressed with breathless urgency&mdash;offering broad appeal through a uniquely distinctive sound. <\/p>\n\n<p>Nick has performed widely at concerts and festivals throughout the United States and also served as a music producer in New York City. <\/p>\n\n<p>Festivals and venues have included European Music Day, Make Music New York Festival, Herndon Festival VA, Eastern Moat Theater in Crete, Rockwood Music Hall, Nublu, The Bitter End, Mercury Lounge, Lucille&rsquo;s BB King&rsquo;s, Sullivan Hall, Piano&rsquo;s, Arlene&rsquo;s Grocery<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://instagram.com/theafronick\">instagram.com/theafronick<\/a><br />\n<a href=\"https://facebook.com/TheAfroNick\">facebook.com/TheAfroNick<\/a><br />\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheAfroNick\">twitter.com/TheAfroNick<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Kosovo born Albanian guitarist <strong>Taulant Mehmeti<\/strong> is a natural improviser, drawing upon the rich Balkan rhythms and gypsy music he grew up hearing and playing. Along with his deep interest in jazz and Django Reinhardt, Charlie Parker and Wes Montgomery as major influences, his musical sensibility is equally informed by funk, rock, and world music genres.
