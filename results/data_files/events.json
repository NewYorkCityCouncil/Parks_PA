Join us on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday mornings for one hour of walking, stretching, and strengthening exercises.<\/p>\n\n<p>For a breath of fresh air, take your workouts outdoors. Parks are becoming a logical alternative environment for those who want to add variety to their workouts, or who just don&#39;t like the gym. And, it&#39;s an affordable way to increase physical activity opportunities, because there&#39;s nothing special to build.<\/p>\n\n<p>Exercise with a view, in natural sunlight, with green scenery all around bestows health benefits that can&rsquo;t be found indoors. Scientific studies have shown that the pleasure of being outdoors for example gives your brain, psyche, and immune system an extra boost.<\/p>\n\n<p>All of our fitness programs are free, led by trained professionals, and suitable for all levels.

Prospect Park Alliance and Turnstile Tours host a series of themed walking tours that examine the many layers of natural and human history to be found in Brooklyn&#39;s Backyard. Tours begin at the Brooklyn Public Library at Grand Army Plaza.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Hidden Treasures Tour (1st Sundays):<\/strong> Explore some of the little-known corners of Prospect Park in this tour that uncovers some of the park&rsquo;s hidden treasures. Once prime attractions, these areas are currently the focus of Prospect Park Alliance restoration efforts to revitalize the park. The tour includes the Rose Garden and Vale of Cashmere in the park&rsquo;s northeast corner, and well as a guided walk through Brooklyn&rsquo;s last remaining forest, the 150-acre Ravine.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Waterways & Wellhouse Tour (2nd Sundays): <\/strong>Prospect Park is an engineering marvel, designed around an ingenious drainage system and a chain of manmade streams and ponds that terminate in Brooklyn&rsquo;s largest lake. This tour will follow the park&rsquo;s scenic watercourse and delve into how Prospect Park Alliance maintains and supports this complex system. The tour will end with a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most unique features of the park: the 1869 Wellhouse, the park&rsquo;s last remaining building by park designer Calvert Vaux, which once housed the machinery that fueled the  watercourse and was recently restored by the Alliance and converted into the first composting restrooms in a NYC park.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Art & Architecture Tour (3rd Sundays): <\/strong>For over 150 years, Prospect Park has been a showcase for beautiful public buildings and artwork, with representations from eras including Beaux-Arts, City Beautiful, the New Deal Modernism, and contemporary LEED-certified projects. This tour will examine some of the fine architectural details and ongoing restoration work, from the era of Vaux and Olmsted to the present day.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Brooklyn&rsquo;s Backyard Tour &ndash; includes Zoo and Carousel admission (4th Sundays): <\/strong>Prospect Park is an oasis for people &ndash; and animals!

Using reclaimed wood as a basis, she appropriates the history of salvaged materials to create structures that evoke the living processes of an organism. Her work, biomorphic yet geometric abstract forms in wood, metal, and other materials, embodies sensuality, ambiguity, and ambivalence. Ms. Gur earned her MFA from Brooklyn College, NY and received her BFA from Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem, Israel. She is the founder of Art Biz Fusion connecting business with artists, and is the Sculptors Alliance Director of Education.

Works in the show range from pencil drawings and oil paint, to cut paper and cast plaster.<\/p>\n\n<p>Artists included are Tatiana Arocha, Marna Chester, Tom Monsees, Sarah Myers, Amy Ross, and Alexandria Tarver.<\/p>\n\n<p>The exhibition is on display through May 31.

Their wealth and influence left behind a legacy that is visible in the street names and landmarks of the area. But just who were the Van Cortlandts anyway? Unlike many prominent early Americans, they did not leave behind journals nor much correspondence to shed light on their story. But some maps and documents do exist&mdash;scattered in various archives and libraries around New York and beyond. These fragments begin to reveal how the Bronx contingent of this family amassed their wealth, expanded their estate, and navigated the turbulence of the American Revolution. <\/p>\n\n<p>The lecture is free to attend but donations to be shared by the Museum and Historical Society are always welcome.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About Van Cortlandt House Museum<\/strong><br />\nSince 1896, Van Cortlandt House Museum has been under the stewardship of The National Society of Colonial Dames in the State of New York through a license agreement with the City of New York.

Even if we feel the affinity to those words, however, we need to first clarify: What is this Divine Feminine? How do we relate to something that has been suppressed and so infrequently discussed or represented?<\/p>\n\n<p>In this talk and discussion, art curator and writer Erin Sickler will take us on a tour of three figures of the feminine divine&ndash;Isis, the High Priestess; Haumea, the Mother Goddess of Hawaii; and Lilith, the spirit of vengeance and the shadow&ndash;and how we can harness the lessons of these archetypes for our own individual and collective transformation.<\/p>\n\n<p>The event will consist of an overview of the stories of Isis, Haumea, and Lilith, and how we might use these archetypes for our own physical, emotional, and psychological healing as well as some somatic exercises.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://snug-harbor.org/event/heal-the-man-in-order-to-heal-the-land-divine-feminine-with-erin-sickler/\">Purchase tickets online<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Heal the Man in order to Heal the Land<\/em><\/strong> explores how spirituality manifests itself out of the connections between internal experience and the material world. How can we connect with nature in a society that continues to give primacy to disposability and mass-consumption? How do we move away from a mindset of scarcity to one of collaboration? How can we be transformed from the egocentric &ldquo;i&rdquo; to the love supreme &ldquo;I AM&rdquo;?  In this work, artist Tattfoo Tan uses participatory prompts, games, and affirmations to engage you in the play of the universe. Let the process begin.<\/p>\n\n<p>Staten Island-based artist Tattfoo Tan&rsquo;s practice focuses on issues relating to ecology, sustainability, and healthy living. His work is project-based, ephemeral and educational in nature. Tan has exhibited at venues including the Queens Museum of Art, Eugene Lang College at the New School for Liberal Arts, Parsons the New School for Design, the Fashion Institute of Technology, Wave Hill, Macalester College, Ballroom Marfa, Creative Time, Project Row Houses, and the Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati. Tan&rsquo;s projects have been presented by the Laundromat Project, the City of New York Department of Cultural Affairs Percent for the Arts program, and the City of Philadelphia Mural Arts program. His work has been published by Gestalten and Thames and Hudson.<\/p>\n\n<p>Tan has been widely recognized for his artistic contributions and service to the community, and is the proud recipient of a proclamation from The City of New York. He is the recipient of grants from Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, Art Matters, Joan Mitchell Foundation, the Pulitzer Arts Foundation, and Staten Island Arts.  In 2010, Tan received the annual Award for Excellence in Design by the Public Design Commission of the City of New York for his design and branding of the Super-Graphic on Bronx River Art Center. He currently serves on the Mayor&rsquo;s Citizens&rsquo; Advisory Committee to support the development of a Comprehensive Cultural Plan.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>All exhibits and programs are located in the Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art (Buildings C & G).

Tours begin at the Brooklyn Public Library at Grand Army Plaza.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Hidden Treasures Tour (1st Sundays):<\/strong> Explore some of the little-known corners of Prospect Park in this tour that uncovers some of the park&rsquo;s hidden treasures. Once prime attractions, these areas are currently the focus of Prospect Park Alliance restoration efforts to revitalize the park. The tour includes the Rose Garden and Vale of Cashmere in the park&rsquo;s northeast corner, and well as a guided walk through Brooklyn&rsquo;s last remaining forest, the 150-acre Ravine.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Waterways & Wellhouse Tour (2nd Sundays): <\/strong>Prospect Park is an engineering marvel, designed around an ingenious drainage system and a chain of manmade streams and ponds that terminate in Brooklyn&rsquo;s largest lake. This tour will follow the park&rsquo;s scenic watercourse and delve into how Prospect Park Alliance maintains and supports this complex system. The tour will end with a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most unique features of the park: the 1869 Wellhouse, the park&rsquo;s last remaining building by park designer Calvert Vaux, which once housed the machinery that fueled the  watercourse and was recently restored by the Alliance and converted into the first composting restrooms in a NYC park.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Art & Architecture Tour (3rd Sundays): <\/strong>For over 150 years, Prospect Park has been a showcase for beautiful public buildings and artwork, with representations from eras including Beaux-Arts, City Beautiful, the New Deal Modernism, and contemporary LEED-certified projects. This tour will examine some of the fine architectural details and ongoing restoration work, from the era of Vaux and Olmsted to the present day.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Brooklyn&rsquo;s Backyard Tour &ndash; includes Zoo and Carousel admission (4th Sundays): <\/strong>Prospect Park is an oasis for people &ndash; and animals! Discover the native habitats and inhabitants of the park, and explore the past and present of recreation, animals, and ongoing conservation efforts of the Prospect Park Alliance.

On Sunday, May 19, visitors will learn about the sacred sites that highlight Flushing&rsquo;s religious diversity.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Flushing is the site of North America&rsquo;s 1st proclamation of religious freedom: the Flushing Remonstrance of 1657, as well as the oldest extant house of worship in New York State: the Quaker Meeting House 1694. The area is now the site of many new churches, temples, and mosques due to both a surge of contemporary immigrants and availability of sizable plots of lands in once-elite residential areas. We&rsquo;ll discuss the ecological and economic problems engendered by the new churches as well as the uncertain status of historic religious institutions.<\/p>\n\n<p>The first stop on our tour will be the Quaker Meeting House (built in 1694). We&rsquo;ll end the tour by 2:30 pm at the St. Michael&rsquo;s Roman Catholic church. <\/p>\n\n<p>We will also pass by a number of remarkable new and older houses of worship from tiny storefront churches to the elaborate Korean Buddhist temple, Masjid Abu Bakr Mosque, Mormon church, Sikh Temple, and Temple (Jewish) Gates of Prayer.<br />\n<br />\nThe tour will be lead by urban geographer Jack Eichenbaum, Ph.D. &ndash; the appointed Queens Borough Historian. His main focus is to promote Queens&rsquo; history-related attractions and changing cultures. His academic career encompasses quantitative and theoretical research on migration, ethnicity, urban growth, and neighborhood change.
