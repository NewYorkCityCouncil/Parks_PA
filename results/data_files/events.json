We serve so many immigrant communities in the park, so to bring together such a diverse roster of faculty makes this program quite special; while the areas of focus are ambitious, the courses will be accessible to all members of our community no matter their level of knowledge on the topic at hand, so we welcome everyone to register and enjoy.&rdquo; <\/p>\n\n<p>The program will take place in the former Rose Garden, located in the northeast corner of Prospect Park, <a href=\"https://www.prospectpark.org/learn-more/reimagine-prospect-park-rose-garden/\">an area that has been the focus of community visioning sessions as part of Prospect Park Alliance&rsquo;s plans for the restoration of this area of the park.<\/a> <\/p>\n\n<p>Following the open call, the Library and the Alliance worked closely with the Library&rsquo;s robust immigration and outreach services team, along with Upwardly Global, Emma&rsquo;s Torch, and World Education Services to bring together a diverse range of professorial candidates. In advance of the lectures, professors will participate in a teacher&rsquo;s training session to help structure the classes. All professors will be compensated for their work. University Open Air will continue with an indoor winter semester and will return to Prospect Park again for a summer semester in 2020, expanding the opportunities for potential professors to share their knowledge with the New York Community. Following last summer&rsquo;s Democracy Lab, the collaboration between the Library and the Alliance broadens both organizations outreach to engage with citizens, as well as serve as a vital resource for Brooklyn&rsquo;s diverse immigrant communities.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 10:00 am<\/p><p>End time: 3:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (718) 965-8951<\/p><p>Location: The Rose Garden<\/p>","parkids":"","parknames":"","start":"2019-06-18 10:00:00","end":"2019-06-18 15:00:00","contact_phone":"(718) 965-8951","location":"The Rose Garden","categories":"Education | Talks","coordinates":"40.66912421916000000, -73.96799683573600000","image":"","pubDate":"Sun, 16 Jun 2019 23:59:33 EDT","pretty_time":"Jun 18 10:00 AM"},{"title":"City Parks Foundation Presents Puss In Boots at the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theatre","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/06/18/city-parks-foundation-presents-puss-in-boots-at-the-swedish-cottage-marionette-theatre","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/06/18/city-parks-foundation-presents-puss-in-boots-at-the-swedish-cottage-marionette-theatre","description":"<p>Date: June 18, 2019<\/p><p><p>City Parks Foundation presents the all-ages show <em>Puss in Boots<\/em> at the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theatre in Central Park, March 19 - September 22, 2019.

We serve so many immigrant communities in the park, so to bring together such a diverse roster of faculty makes this program quite special; while the areas of focus are ambitious, the courses will be accessible to all members of our community no matter their level of knowledge on the topic at hand, so we welcome everyone to register and enjoy.&rdquo; <\/p>\n\n<p>The program will take place in the former Rose Garden, located in the northeast corner of Prospect Park, <a href=\"https://www.prospectpark.org/learn-more/reimagine-prospect-park-rose-garden/\">an area that has been the focus of community visioning sessions as part of Prospect Park Alliance&rsquo;s plans for the restoration of this area of the park.<\/a> <\/p>\n\n<p>Following the open call, the Library and the Alliance worked closely with the Library&rsquo;s robust immigration and outreach services team, along with Upwardly Global, Emma&rsquo;s Torch, and World Education Services to bring together a diverse range of professorial candidates. In advance of the lectures, professors will participate in a teacher&rsquo;s training session to help structure the classes. All professors will be compensated for their work. University Open Air will continue with an indoor winter semester and will return to Prospect Park again for a summer semester in 2020, expanding the opportunities for potential professors to share their knowledge with the New York Community. Following last summer&rsquo;s Democracy Lab, the collaboration between the Library and the Alliance broadens both organizations outreach to engage with citizens, as well as serve as a vital resource for Brooklyn&rsquo;s diverse immigrant communities.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 10:00 am<\/p><p>End time: 3:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (718) 965-8951<\/p><p>Location: The Rose Garden<\/p>","parkids":"","parknames":"","start":"2019-06-20 10:00:00","end":"2019-06-20 15:00:00","contact_phone":"(718) 965-8951","location":"The Rose Garden","categories":"Education | Talks","coordinates":"40.66912421916000000, -73.96799683573600000","image":"","pubDate":"Sun, 16 Jun 2019 23:59:33 EDT","pretty_time":"Jun 20 10:00 AM"},{"title":"Summer on the Hudson: Locomotive Lawn Live!","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/06/20/summer-on-the-hudson-locomotive-lawn-live","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/06/20/summer-on-the-hudson-locomotive-lawn-live","description":"<p>Date: June 20, 2019<\/p><p><p><a href=\"http://moosikikids.com/index.htm\">Moosiki Kids Musical Storytime<\/a> fosters a love of reading at a young age with stories and sing-along on our comfy and danceable turf lawn by the big locomotive. <\/p>\n\n<p>This event is great for kids aged 5 years and under!

Boats are available on a first-come-first-served basis, no reservations.<\/p>\n\n<p>Rowing is a beautifully simple, healthy, and empowering sport, and the waters of the lake are an ideal place to pursue its pleasures. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Who can participate:<\/strong><br />\nCommunity rowing is open to all, although some physical agility is required to get in and out of the boats. The focus of the program is recreation in a safe and respectful environment. Each adult must sign a waiver; children must be accompanied by a parent. Life jackets are provided&mdash;and must be worn!<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Volunteers<\/strong> are greatly appreciated! To help with set up, meet at the container in the parking lot south of the lake at 4:00 p.m.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Cost<\/strong><br />\nIt&rsquo;s free. Village Community Boathouse is a nonprofit organization entirely run by volunteers. While no commitment is required from those who row with us, our facilities, boats and equipment require regular upkeep and repair. Please consider making a donation of money or time to make our programs possible.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About Village Community Boathouse<\/strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.villagecommunityboathouse.org/\">Village Community Boathouse<\/a> is a nonprofit based on Pier 40 at the west end of Houston Street. At the boathouse we build, maintain, and row a fleet of traditional wooden rowboats. Our rowing program on the Hudson uses Whitehall Gigs, 25 foot long boats for four rowers which can handle the conditions and traffic of the harbor. We have programs using the smaller boats in Prospect Park in Brooklyn and Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. The boats are traditional handmade wooden rowboats of a variety of designs. Some of them were built at Pier 40 as part of our Community Boatbuilding program.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 4:30 pm<\/p><p>End time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: South end of lake (in Van Cortlandt Park)<\/p>","parkids":"X092","parknames":"Van Cortlandt Park","start":"2019-06-21 16:30:00","end":"2019-06-21 19:00:00","location":"South end of lake (in Van Cortlandt Park)","categories":"Nature | Kayaking and Canoeing","coordinates":"40.88915215898600000, -73.89286369085300000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5cfbcfad32cca.JPG","pubDate":"Sun, 16 Jun 2019 23:59:33 EDT","pretty_time":"Jun 21 04:30 PM"},{"title":"Summer on the Hudson: Make Music New York","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/06/21/summer-on-the-hudson-make-music-new-york","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/06/21/summer-on-the-hudson-make-music-new-york","description":"<p>Date: June 21, 2019<\/p><p><p><em>On the Waterfront: American Music for Piano Duet<\/em> highlights American four-hand piano music played by young students and professional adult headliners.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 5:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 870-3070<\/p><p>Location: Pier I (in Riverside Park South)<\/p>","parkids":"M353","parknames":"Riverside Park South","start":"2019-06-21 17:00:00","end":"2019-06-21 19:00:00","contact_phone":"(212) 870-3070","location":"Pier I (in Riverside Park South)","categories":"Concerts | Waterfront","coordinates":"40.77970123291000000, -73.98889923095700000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5c784f7d1cee7.JPG","pubDate":"Sun, 16 Jun 2019 23:59:33 EDT","pretty_time":"Jun 21 05:00 PM"},{"title":"Quiet Clubbing at Highland Park","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/06/21/quiet-clubbing","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/06/21/quiet-clubbing","description":"<p>Date: June 21, 2019<\/p><p><p>This family-friendly headphone party has music from every generation to enjoy.

In 2009, he formed the band &ldquo;Stray Blue&rdquo; and toured throughout Crete, premiering one of the first Indie-Rock band tours on the island.<\/p>\n\n<p>Known for his wild, expressive hair&mdash;which incidentally serves as his namesake&mdash;it symbolizes uninhibited freedom, a tangible representation of childhood rebellion extended into adulthood.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now based in Brooklyn, he offers audiences the chance to experience his Indie-Rock through stirring lyrics, expressed with breathless urgency&mdash;offering broad appeal through a uniquely distinctive sound. <\/p>\n\n<p>Nick has performed widely at concerts and festivals throughout the United States and also served as a music producer in New York City. <\/p>\n\n<p>Festivals and venues have included European Music Day, Make Music New York Festival, Herndon Festival VA, Eastern Moat Theater in Crete, Rockwood Music Hall, Nublu, The Bitter End, Mercury Lounge, Lucille&rsquo;s BB King&rsquo;s, Sullivan Hall, Piano&rsquo;s, Arlene&rsquo;s Grocery<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://instagram.com/theafronick\">instagram.com/theafronick<\/a><br />\n<a href=\"https://facebook.com/TheAfroNick\">facebook.com/TheAfroNick<\/a><br />\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheAfroNick\">twitter.com/TheAfroNick<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Kosovo born Albanian guitarist <strong>Taulant Mehmeti<\/strong> is a natural improviser, drawing upon the rich Balkan rhythms and gypsy music he grew up hearing and playing.

Taulant&#39;s music weaves these bright strands into a shimmering tapestry of his own creation. <\/p>\n\n<p>As a youngster in war-torn Kosovo, Taulant Mehmeti amazed local audiences with his songwriting talent and musicianship. Under the mentorship of renowned local jazz guitaristArmend Xhaferi, he developed into a leading jazz player in Kosovo and Albania.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Now an active performer on the New York scene, Mehmeti has played, as a leader and a sideman, in venues including Blue Note, B.B.Kings and Iridium just to name a few. <\/p>\n\n<p>Taulant&#39;s performances have taken him to over 20 countries and varied settings, among them: TED Talks and Prishtina Jazz Festival in Kosovo; Bern Jazz Festival in Switzerland, International Gypsy Romanian Festival Bucharest; Tirana Jazz Festival and Shkodra Summer Jazz, Albania; Castellon Jazz Festival in Spain, Reykjavik Jazz Festival in Iceland, Jazz a Carthage in Tunisia, Contours of Contemporary Kosovo Istanbul, Turkey, Jazz Appreciation Month at WBGO in New Jersey; and in New York: Stars of Tomorrow- Hudson River Park, Jazz in the Square and Ideas City Festival - New Museum.  <\/p>\n\n<p>He has performed with artists such as Vic Juris, Armend Xhaferi, Ilir Bajri, Linda Brice&ntilde;o, Baden Goyo, Nesim Maxhuni, and Gabriel Chakarji.    <\/p>\n\n<p>His debut jazz album <em>Pinxhur&#39;n&#39;Pestil<\/em> with his band Trio of Love, received positive press and garnered airplay, including a New Year&#39;s Eve live TV performance on KlanKosova network in Kosovo.

In New York Classical&rsquo;s production, the entire cast will swap roles (and genders) every other performance to explore the power dynamics in the script.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://ci.ovationtix.com/35099\">RSVP for free<\/a> <\/strong>and get up to date information on cancellations, directions, night-of restaurant suggestions, and more.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 7:00 am<\/p><p>End time: 9:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (718) 802-0603<\/p><p>Location: Pier 1 (in Brooklyn Bridge Park)<\/p>","parkids":"B431","parknames":"Brooklyn Bridge Park","start":"2019-06-22 07:00:00","end":"2019-06-22 21:00:00","contact_phone":"(718) 802-0603","location":"Pier 1 (in Brooklyn Bridge Park)","categories":"Theater | Free Summer Theater","coordinates":"40.70294877799900000, -73.99473768472700000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5cf7dbe5ca11f.jpg","pubDate":"Sun, 16 Jun 2019 23:59:33 EDT","pretty_time":"Jun 22 07:00 AM"},{"title":"Yoga Fitness Classes at the Unisphere","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/06/22/yoga-fitness-classes-at-the-unisphere","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/06/22/yoga-fitness-classes-at-the-unisphere","description":"<p>Date: June 22, 2019<\/p><p><p>Grab your yoga mat and join us for free weekly Yoga classes outdoors at the Unisphere.

We serve so many immigrant communities in the park, so to bring together such a diverse roster of faculty makes this program quite special; while the areas of focus are ambitious, the courses will be accessible to all members of our community no matter their level of knowledge on the topic at hand, so we welcome everyone to register and enjoy.&rdquo; <\/p>\n\n<p>The program will take place in the former Rose Garden, located in the northeast corner of Prospect Park, <a href=\"https://www.prospectpark.org/learn-more/reimagine-prospect-park-rose-garden/\">an area that has been the focus of community visioning sessions as part of Prospect Park Alliance&rsquo;s plans for the restoration of this area of the park.<\/a> <\/p>\n\n<p>Following the open call, the Library and the Alliance worked closely with the Library&rsquo;s robust immigration and outreach services team, along with Upwardly Global, Emma&rsquo;s Torch, and World Education Services to bring together a diverse range of professorial candidates. In advance of the lectures, professors will participate in a teacher&rsquo;s training session to help structure the classes. All professors will be compensated for their work. University Open Air will continue with an indoor winter semester and will return to Prospect Park again for a summer semester in 2020, expanding the opportunities for potential professors to share their knowledge with the New York Community. Following last summer&rsquo;s Democracy Lab, the collaboration between the Library and the Alliance broadens both organizations outreach to engage with citizens, as well as serve as a vital resource for Brooklyn&rsquo;s diverse immigrant communities.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 10:00 am<\/p><p>End time: 3:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (718) 965-8951<\/p><p>Location: The Rose Garden<\/p>","parkids":"","parknames":"","start":"2019-06-22 10:00:00","end":"2019-06-22 15:00:00","contact_phone":"(718) 965-8951","location":"The Rose Garden","categories":"Education | Talks","coordinates":"40.66912421916000000, -73.96799683573600000","image":"","pubDate":"Sun, 16 Jun 2019 23:59:33 EDT","pretty_time":"Jun 22 10:00 AM"},{"title":"Artsy Bloom Community Garden Opening","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/06/22/artsy-bloom-community-garden-opening","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/06/22/artsy-bloom-community-garden-opening","description":"<p>Date: June 22, 2019<\/p><p><p>Come to Artsy Bloom Community Garden in East New York for a day in the garden!

This tour will follow the park&rsquo;s scenic watercourse and delve into how Prospect Park Alliance maintains and supports this complex system. The tour will end with a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most unique features of the park: the 1869 Wellhouse, the park&rsquo;s last remaining building by park designer Calvert Vaux, which once housed the machinery that fueled the  watercourse and was recently restored by the Alliance and converted into the first composting restrooms in a NYC park.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Art & Architecture Tour (3rd Sundays): <\/strong>For over 150 years, Prospect Park has been a showcase for beautiful public buildings and artwork, with representations from eras including Beaux-Arts, City Beautiful, the New Deal Modernism, and contemporary LEED-certified projects.

Parents, children, elders, extended family and friends all participated in the making of formal images and left with a large format print of themselves free of charge.<\/p>\n\n<p>This project is a collaboration with ArtBuilt, Queens Museum, DreamYard, WHEDco, Bronx Defenders and NYC Parks.<\/p>\n\n<p>This exhibition is an extension of ArtBuilt Mobile Studio in the Park, made possible by the National Endowment for the Arts, Surdna Foundation, and The New York Community Trust. Additional support is provided by the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs and the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York State Legislature.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 9:00 am<\/p><p>End time: 5:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 360-8163<\/p><p>Location: Arsenal (in Central Park)<\/p>","parkids":"M010","parknames":"Central Park","start":"2019-06-24 09:00:00","end":"2019-06-24 17:00:00","contact_phone":"(212) 360-8163","location":"Arsenal (in Central Park)","categories":"Accessible | Art | History | Seniors","coordinates":"40.76720046997100000, -73.97129821777300000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5cf68d2f78c67.jpeg","pubDate":"Sun, 16 Jun 2019 23:59:33 EDT","pretty_time":"Jun 24 09:00 AM"},{"title":"Summer Open Village","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/06/24/summer-open-village","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/06/24/summer-open-village","description":"<p>Date: June 24, 2019<\/p><p><p>Historic Richmond Town&rsquo;s Main Village site comes alive with the sights, sounds, tastes, and smells of New York City&rsquo;s rural past!<\/p>\n\n<p>Visit skilled artisans as they practice their trade, tour the restored interiors of period homes, take part in civic life, and browse working shops and functioning open hearth kitchens.<\/p>\n\n<p>Be a part of your community past, present, and future!

We serve so many immigrant communities in the park, so to bring together such a diverse roster of faculty makes this program quite special; while the areas of focus are ambitious, the courses will be accessible to all members of our community no matter their level of knowledge on the topic at hand, so we welcome everyone to register and enjoy.&rdquo; <\/p>\n\n<p>The program will take place in the former Rose Garden, located in the northeast corner of Prospect Park, <a href=\"https://www.prospectpark.org/learn-more/reimagine-prospect-park-rose-garden/\">an area that has been the focus of community visioning sessions as part of Prospect Park Alliance&rsquo;s plans for the restoration of this area of the park.<\/a> <\/p>\n\n<p>Following the open call, the Library and the Alliance worked closely with the Library&rsquo;s robust immigration and outreach services team, along with Upwardly Global, Emma&rsquo;s Torch, and World Education Services to bring together a diverse range of professorial candidates. In advance of the lectures, professors will participate in a teacher&rsquo;s training session to help structure the classes. All professors will be compensated for their work. University Open Air will continue with an indoor winter semester and will return to Prospect Park again for a summer semester in 2020, expanding the opportunities for potential professors to share their knowledge with the New York Community.

We serve so many immigrant communities in the park, so to bring together such a diverse roster of faculty makes this program quite special; while the areas of focus are ambitious, the courses will be accessible to all members of our community no matter their level of knowledge on the topic at hand, so we welcome everyone to register and enjoy.&rdquo; <\/p>\n\n<p>The program will take place in the former Rose Garden, located in the northeast corner of Prospect Park, <a href=\"https://www.prospectpark.org/learn-more/reimagine-prospect-park-rose-garden/\">an area that has been the focus of community visioning sessions as part of Prospect Park Alliance&rsquo;s plans for the restoration of this area of the park.<\/a> <\/p>\n\n<p>Following the open call, the Library and the Alliance worked closely with the Library&rsquo;s robust immigration and outreach services team, along with Upwardly Global, Emma&rsquo;s Torch, and World Education Services to bring together a diverse range of professorial candidates. In advance of the lectures, professors will participate in a teacher&rsquo;s training session to help structure the classes. All professors will be compensated for their work. University Open Air will continue with an indoor winter semester and will return to Prospect Park again for a summer semester in 2020, expanding the opportunities for potential professors to share their knowledge with the New York Community.

At the boathouse we build, maintain, and row a fleet of traditional wooden rowboats. Our rowing program on the Hudson uses Whitehall Gigs, 25 foot long boats for four rowers which can handle the conditions and traffic of the harbor. We have programs using the smaller boats in Prospect Park in Brooklyn and Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. The boats are traditional handmade wooden rowboats of a variety of designs. Some of them were built at Pier 40 as part of our Community Boatbuilding program.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 4:30 pm<\/p><p>End time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: South end of lake (in Van Cortlandt Park)<\/p>","parkids":"X092","parknames":"Van Cortlandt Park","start":"2019-06-28 16:30:00","end":"2019-06-28 19:00:00","location":"South end of lake (in Van Cortlandt Park)","categories":"Nature | Kayaking and Canoeing","coordinates":"40.88915215898600000, -73.89286369085300000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5cfbcfad32cca.JPG","pubDate":"Sun, 16 Jun 2019 23:59:33 EDT","pretty_time":"Jun 28 04:30 PM"},{"title":"Art Inspired By Thierry Bishe","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/06/28/art-inspired-by-thierry-bishe","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/06/28/art-inspired-by-thierry-bishe","description":"<p>Date: June 28, 2019<\/p><p><p>Come create your own masterpiece inspired by work from famous artists and various techniques.

We serve so many immigrant communities in the park, so to bring together such a diverse roster of faculty makes this program quite special; while the areas of focus are ambitious, the courses will be accessible to all members of our community no matter their level of knowledge on the topic at hand, so we welcome everyone to register and enjoy.&rdquo; <\/p>\n\n<p>The program will take place in the former Rose Garden, located in the northeast corner of Prospect Park, <a href=\"https://www.prospectpark.org/learn-more/reimagine-prospect-park-rose-garden/\">an area that has been the focus of community visioning sessions as part of Prospect Park Alliance&rsquo;s plans for the restoration of this area of the park.<\/a> <\/p>\n\n<p>Following the open call, the Library and the Alliance worked closely with the Library&rsquo;s robust immigration and outreach services team, along with Upwardly Global, Emma&rsquo;s Torch, and World Education Services to bring together a diverse range of professorial candidates. In advance of the lectures, professors will participate in a teacher&rsquo;s training session to help structure the classes. All professors will be compensated for their work.

Hospicio Caba&ntilde;as was a playable stage in the 1993 arcade hit Super Street Fighter II and served as the home court for Thunder Hawk, the first Mexican video game character. Orozco has created a pixelated mosaic of Thunder Hawk&rsquo;s stage on a large column using heirloom corn kernels, looking to inject the character&rsquo;s backstory with greater historical and cultural relevance lost in the game&rsquo;s original depiction.<br />\n<br />\nFor the sculpture&rsquo;s unveiling on June 30, Orozco has partnered with New York and New Jersey-based Mexican indigenous performance group Tonalxochitl Danza Mexica to celebrate histories of colonial resistance. Tonalxochitl Danza Mexica is a community organization founded by Cecilia Ortega dedicated to preserving Mexican indigenous ways through music, dance, performance, and ceremony.<br />\n<br />\nThis program is supported by the Alliance for Flushing Meadows Corona Park, NYC Parks Art in the Parks, and CityLore.
