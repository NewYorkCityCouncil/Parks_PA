Some of the fish living in the Meer include largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, bluegill sunfish, carp, and chain pickerel.<\/p>\n\n<p>Fishing poles are available to borrow at the <a href=\"http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/charles-a-dana-discovery-center.html\">Charles A.

This event is free; registration is not required.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Fishing Guidelines:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Release fish gently. All fishing is on a \"catch-and-release\" basis only, meaning that all fish caught must be put back into the water immediately.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please wet your hands before handling fish, and release while the fish is underwater if possible.<\/p>\n\n<p>Use safe fishing equipment. The use of barbs on hooks, lead sinkers and overhead casting rods is strictly prohibited. Monofilament line should be properly discarded of in the Charles A. Dana Discovery Center to avoid harming wildlife.<\/p>\n\n<p>Respect the turtles and waterfowl. If you see a turtle or bird near your hook, please move to another spot to avoid catching it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please fish with complimentary fish bait (corn kernels) from the Dana Center ONLY. The use of bread products and hot dogs as bait is discouraged as it has been found to be harmful to both the wildlife and the water bodies.<\/p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t feed the wildlife. Feeding any other wildlife and digging for worms is strictly prohibited.<\/p>\n\n<p>Stay on pathways, ramps, and steps next to the water. Excessive trampling of the natural shoreline and wading in the water kills the grass and causes soil erosion and compaction. This creates poor living conditions for plants, fish and other Meer dwellers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Visitors over age 16 using their own fishing equipment must have a fishing license. Visitors using equipment from the Dana Center do not need a fishing license.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 11:00 am<\/p><p>End time: 4:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 310-6600<\/p><p>Location: Charles A.

Callahan will perform 106 Kerri Chandler Chords for voice and computer, a work derived from his project Housed, an archive of (currently) 850 chords from classic House tracks Callahan collected in 2016, which was released on NNA Tapes and is currently being turned into an online archive.<\/p>\n\n<p>Jack Callahan received a BA in Music Composition & Theory from Hampshire College in 2012. He currently curates the concert series Pennies from Heaven in collaboration with Control Synthesizers and Electronic Devices in Brooklyn. In 2018 he coauthored the manifesto <a href=\"http://www.banhmiverlag.com/agave\">Toward Agave Expressionism<\/a> with Alec Sturgis. This lead to the establishment of the festival Neo-Pastiche: Changes in American Music, which will take place in Asheville, NC in April 2019.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now its sixth season, Musical Ecologies is a monthly symposium on music and sound held at the Old Stone House in Park Slope, Brooklyn.
