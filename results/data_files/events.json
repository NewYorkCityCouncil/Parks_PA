Tunes are those that are typically suitable for contra dancing or other traditional fiddle tunes.<\/p>\n\n<p>This group is intended to provide a musical home for folks interested in playing tunes with other musicians, learning to play by ear and overall increasing their own musical skill. It&rsquo;s fun and welcoming to all ages and levels of playing. While we won&rsquo;t play from sheet music, you can certainly use this as a reference on your own!<br />\n<br />\nWhat do you mean by slow jam? All acoustic instruments (e.g., fiddle, mandolin, guitar, cello, etc.) are welcome and the typical format is that we sit in a circle (or circle-ish, depending on the space) and take turns suggesting/leading a song. The songs will typically follow the AABB format (two &ldquo;A&rdquo; parts followed by two &ldquo;B&rdquo; parts) and we will simply play it over many repeats and if you know it, great, but if you don&rsquo;t, you try to figure it out as we go along, maybe picking up a few notes here and there. We&rsquo;ll play tunes at a slow to moderate speed so that they are accessible to a variety of levels.<br />\n<br />\nIt&rsquo;s fun and can be challenging, but is a great way to improve your playing. You don&rsquo;t have to be a great player, play in tune, or know the songs to give it a shot. If you want to suggest a song, you should either know the song well enough to play it on repeat or we can see if anyone else does!<br />\n <\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 9:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: Old Stone House (in J.J.

Papp&rsquo;s original touring company evolved into the New York Shakespeare Festival, and ultimately became The Public Theater. All of it was built on a simple idea: Culture belongs to everyone. This idea remains at the heart of The Public Theater&rsquo;s work to this day. And our Mobile Unit still takes this mission out to the communities across New York City, providing free performances to all. The Mobile Unit presents free Shakespeare to prisons, homeless shelters, and community centers throughout New York&rsquo;s boroughs. Over the years, the Mobile Unit has served thousands of audiences with critically-acclaimed productions. In addition to the community tour, each Mobile Unit show &ldquo;sits down&rdquo; at The Public Theater&rsquo;s Astor Place home to perform for Public audiences and community organizations from all over the city.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 6:30 pm<\/p><p>End time: 8:30 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 860-1380<\/p><p>Location: Pelham Fritz Recreation Center (in Marcus Garvey Park)<\/p>","parkids":"M058","parknames":"Marcus Garvey Park","start":"2019-04-05 18:30:00","end":"2019-04-05 20:30:00","contact_phone":"(212) 860-1380","location":"Pelham Fritz Recreation Center (in Marcus Garvey Park)","categories":"Accessible | Theater | Seniors","coordinates":"40.80502319335900000, -73.94498443603500000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5c7947c641cdd.JPG","pubDate":"Sun, 31 Mar 2019 23:59:32 EDT","pretty_time":"Apr 05 06:30 PM"},{"title":"Senior Games Clinics: Basketball","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/04/06/senior-games-clinics-basketball","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/04/06/senior-games-clinics-basketball","description":"<p>Date: April 6, 2019<\/p><p><p>Train with us for the <a href=\"/highlights/festivals/senior-games\">NYC Parks Senior Games<\/a>!

The Mobile Unit presents free Shakespeare to prisons, homeless shelters, and community centers throughout New York&rsquo;s boroughs.

Papp&rsquo;s original touring company evolved into the New York Shakespeare Festival, and ultimately became The Public Theater. All of it was built on a simple idea: Culture belongs to everyone. This idea remains at the heart of The Public Theater&rsquo;s work to this day. And our Mobile Unit still takes this mission out to the communities across New York City, providing free performances to all. The Mobile Unit presents free Shakespeare to prisons, homeless shelters, and community centers throughout New York&rsquo;s boroughs. Over the years, the Mobile Unit has served thousands of audiences with critically acclaimed productions. In addition to the community tour, each Mobile Unit show &ldquo;sits down&rdquo; at The Public Theater&rsquo;s Astor Place home to perform for Public audiences and community organizations from all over the city.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 8:30 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (718) 543-8672<\/p><p>Location: Williamsbridge Oval Recreation Center (in Williamsbridge Oval)<\/p>","parkids":"X104","parknames":"Williamsbridge Oval","start":"2019-04-11 19:00:00","end":"2019-04-11 20:30:00","contact_phone":"(718) 543-8672","location":"Williamsbridge Oval Recreation Center (in Williamsbridge Oval)","categories":"Accessible | Theater | Seniors","coordinates":"40.87669691244100000, -73.87855219841000000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5c7949e9076eb.JPG","pubDate":"Sun, 31 Mar 2019 23:59:32 EDT","pretty_time":"Apr 11 07:00 PM"},{"title":"Senior Games Clinics: Basketball","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/04/12/senior-games-clinics-basketball1","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/04/12/senior-games-clinics-basketball1","description":"<p>Date: April 12, 2019<\/p><p><p>Train with us for the <a href=\"/highlights/festivals/senior-games\">NYC Parks Senior Games<\/a>!

Based in Brooklyn, Hupfield is a citizen of the Anishinaabek Nation from Wasauksing First Nation in Ontario, Canada. Her sculptural body-objects, crafted from industrial felt, are often activated through performance. Also based in Brooklyn, Filipina-Canadian artist Jimenez&rsquo;s installations and performances draw from familial narratives, abandoned objects and colonial texts, as well as photos, maps, and textiles, to focus on concepts of origin and home, loss, and absence. In the Sunroom Project Space, Rachel Sydlowski&rsquo;s installation consists of layers of historical wallpaper that serve as a background for complex screen-print collages of flora and fauna, architectural details and decorative motifs from Wave Hill, Inwood Hill Park, and other surrounding green spaces, transforming the Sunroom into an anachronistic collage of past and present.<\/p>\n\n<p>Pictured: Sara Jimenez, Binding Time, 2015, Floral compost and fabric, 15 x 11 x 8 feet, Image by Daniel Kukla<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 2:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 4:30 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (718) 549-3200<\/p><p>Location: Glyndor Gallery (in Wave Hill)<\/p>","parkids":"X209","parknames":"Wave Hill","start":"2019-04-14 14:00:00","end":"2019-04-14 16:30:00","contact_phone":"(718) 549-3200","location":"Glyndor Gallery (in Wave Hill)","categories":"Art","coordinates":"40.89886474609375000, -73.91186523437500000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5c61a3158a6d5.jpg","pubDate":"Sun, 31 Mar 2019 23:59:32 EDT","pretty_time":"Apr 14 02:00 PM"},{"title":"Central Park Tour: Seneca Village","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/04/14/central-park-tour-seneca-village","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/04/14/central-park-tour-seneca-village","description":"<p>Date: April 14, 2019<\/p><p><p>Seneca Village was an important community of predominantly African-American property owners, living in an area that now makes up part of Central Park.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Join Central Park Conservancy guides on this tour to learn about the lives of Seneca Village&rsquo;s residents in the 1800s and the community&rsquo;s place in pre-Central Park.
